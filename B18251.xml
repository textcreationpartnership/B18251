            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Here present to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships view, Two small Tracts; the one shewing the Quakers presumptuous Claim, to the Title of being themselves the only True Catholick Church of Christ, the Elect People of God, and Church of the first Born; and that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Order of the Church of Christ is Re-established amongst them; and them only, which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so or no, let the World judge, when they have heard, and come more and more to know their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, Principles, and Practises,
<pb facs="tcp:199413:3"/> which are now every day more and more exposed; and in order to a farther discovery of their pernitious Errors, I have (according to my small Tallent) cast in my Mite; which I hope will not be unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Your Lordships, who are set as Overseers of the Church; and cannot but be affected with sorrow, when you see so many, (and some of them well meaning Souls) incorporate themselves into the Communion of this Erronious Sect; and indeed the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, because the most prevailing: But, I hope, they are at the heighth, and their Folly is so manifest, and their Errors are so discover'd; that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> said, that as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withstood <hi>Moses;</hi> so did many in his days hold dangerous Errors; and so
<pb facs="tcp:199413:3"/> willfully persisted in them that they resisted the Truth; who were Men of corrupt minds, and not only so, but Reprobates concerning the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ: But St. <hi>Paul</hi> comforts himself, and his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> (to whom he had given di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things in charge) saying, They shall proceed no further, for their Folly shall be made manifest to all Men: And I am perswaded, that both the Folly and Danger of this erroneous Sect will be so manifest in a little time, that the gangrene of their Heresie shall prevail no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which God of his mercy grant for Christ's sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Tract mentioned, which I now call the second Part, is a Correction of the late <hi>General History of the Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. Wrot by Mr. <hi>Croese,</hi> wherein he has been
<pb facs="tcp:199413:4"/> very partial in many things, which I charitably suppose might be done, partly for want of a thorow know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Tenets, and partly thorow wrong Information; and thereby have both reflected upon the Government, and Church of <hi>England,</hi> to the advantage of that willingly ignorant and pernicious Sect of the Quakers; and which I have endeavoured to set right accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that knowledge I have of that People: Their Books, their Principles, their Practices, and way and manner of their Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which they pretend to be Apostolical.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I have not leisure to trace them in all their by-pathes, from the very beginning of their rise, and to shew how they branched forth from the Seeds of the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:199413:4"/> Levellers, and other <hi>Latitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians;</hi> nor do I certainly know that the Jesuits had a hand in their forming, but will say with my Lord of <hi>Worcester,</hi> in his Book En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>A Discourse concerning the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Church of Rome,</hi> &amp;c. p. 282. viz. <q>Any one who compares them (<hi>i. e.</hi> Jesuits and Quakers) would imagine the Life of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had been their great Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler. I know not whether any of that innocent Order of Jesuits had any hand in forming this new So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (<hi>i. e.</hi> Quakers) amongst us, as has been frequently suggested; but if one may guess the Father by the Child's likeness, <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the Founder of the Jesuits, was at least the Grand-Father of the Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> To which let me add an Abstract of a Letter from
<pb facs="tcp:199413:5"/> the Right Reverend, <hi>J. Bramhall,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Derry, aftewardr</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>James Usher</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Armagh, July</hi> 20. 1654. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>I thank God I do take my Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage patiently; yet I cannot but condole the change of the Church and State of <hi>England;</hi> and more in my Pilgrimage than ever, because I dare not witness and declare to that stray'd Flock of our Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> who have misled them, and who they are that feed them. But, that your Lordship may be more sensible of the Churches Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and of the danger she is in of being ruined, if God be not merciful unto her, I have sent you a part of my Discoveries <hi>(i. e.)</hi> That in the year 1646. by Order from <hi>Rome</hi> above 100 of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<pb facs="tcp:199413:5"/> Clergy were sent into <hi>England,</hi> consisting of <hi>English, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> who had been Educated in <hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in each of those Romish Nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. These Scholars were taught several handicraft Traids and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as their ingenuities were most bending, besides their Orders and Functions of that Church. They have many yet at <hi>Paris</hi> a fitting up to send over, who twice in the Week oppose one the other; when the Romish Orders do thus Argue <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> there is appointed one of the learned of those Convents; and to take Notes as he find their Fancies, for This, That, and the other Opinion, new Tenents; so accordingly they be to act, and to exercise their Wits; accordingly upon their permission, when they
<pb facs="tcp:199413:6"/> be sent abroad, they enter their Names in the Convent Registry; also their Licences if a Franciscan, if a Dominican or Jesuit; and for assurance of their constancy to their several Orders, they are to give monthly Intelligence to the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities of all Affairs where-ever they be dispersed: So that, the <hi>English</hi> abroad know News better than you at home:</q> All which is left to every Man to judge as he finds reason to do. And being loath to detain your Lordships, I beg leave to subscribe my self,</p>

                     <p>HAving in my former Books, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly my <hi>second Summary,</hi> &amp;c. p. 8. set forth the Quakers Judgment and Opinion of all the Protestant Churches to be no Churches of Christ; but the Synagogue of Satan; and their Ministers a false Ministry: Even <hi>All</hi> that Baptize Children with Water, <hi>All</hi> that Preach Christ without, as he is in Heaven above at God's right Hand; <hi>All</hi> that Preach out of the Scriptures; <hi>All</hi> that tell People of a Sacrament, and that it is God's Ordinance; <hi>All</hi> that pay Tythes or receive Tythes: In a word, <hi>All</hi> Ministers, (not Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) are, say they, false Ministers; and as such they are Conjurers, Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Antichrists, Witches, and blind Guides,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:199413:10"/> Devils and Serpents, Liers, whose Call and Commission came from <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Sir <hi>Simons</hi> of the Age, Stewards of the Devils Magazine, a Viperous Generation of Disemblers and Blasphemers, holding a worm-eaten Beastly form selling Beastly Wares; <hi>The Letter</hi> which is <hi>Dust</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> yea, greedy Dogs, Blood-Hounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that should I inlarge on this Head I should repeat too much out of my former Books, which shew at large their contempt, not only of Scripture, Sacraments, and all-instituted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but of all Christian Churches, Ministry and Magistracy; and that from plain matter of fact out of their printed and approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; and therefore shall proceed to disprove their pretence of being the only Apostolical Church of Christ.</p>

                        <hi>The Apostate Incendiary,</hi> &amp;c. p. 3. <q>Dear Friends, it was for your sakes and the Truth, that I was pressed in Spirit in a Godly Zeal thus to appear against this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Worker and Treacherous Spirit, which at length hath shewed it self in open Enmity against the Truth, <hi>Viz. The Church of Christ and Elect People of God, called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> &amp;c.</q> By which 'tis plain, that they Arrogate to themselves, as Quakers to be the Church and Elect People of God. The next Proof, is out of their Book stiled, <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the Ranters,</hi> &amp;c. p. 1. <q>That as the True and Pure-Principles of the Gospel are restored by (the Quakers) Testimony, so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199413:10"/> The Ancient Apostolical Order in the Church of Christ is Re-established amongst them, and settled upon it's Right Basis and Foundation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Thus do <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>Robert Barkly,</hi> jointly agree, that the Quakers as such are the Church of Christ the Elect Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. And then notwithstanding their contrariety to all Professors of Christianity; yet amongst them and by their Testimony, the ancient Apostolick Order of the Church of Christ is Re-established amongst them; and not only so, but settled upon it's Right Basis and Foundation: And then <hi>R. Barkly</hi> proceeds in his Preface to shew and assert the Power of their Church thus restored and settled amongst them, comparatively with that of the Apostles, and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Power of decision and Judge of Controversies; which he one while to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void <hi>Romes</hi> Infallibility, tells the World that they place the said Power in the Spirit of God; and tells us the Spirit of God is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; a thing which no body denies; but by and by he does as positively place Infallabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Members of their Church, as the boldest Romanists ever did or can do: As may be seen by the Question proposed, and his Answer to it of the same Book, in p. 66. <hi>Viz.</hi>
                        <q>Who is the proper Judge and Judges, in whom recideth the Power of deciding Controversies. Answer, This is that (saith <hi>Barkly</hi>) which I undertake in the next place to treat of; as being the Specifick Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199413:11"/> and distinguishing Property of the Church of Christ, from all other Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assemblies and Churches of Man's Building, <hi>viz.</hi> To give a short, yet clear and plain Answer to this Proposition. The only proper Judge of Controversies in the Church of Christ is the Spirit of God, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of deciding solely lies in it, as having the only unerring Infallible and certain Judgment belonging to it; which Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not necessarily annexed to any Persons or Places whatsoever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now by what is thus far said, in Answer to the said Question.</q> A Man not skil'd in the Quakers Logick, would think them far enough from pretending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves their Church, their Counsels or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Infallible, but in p. 67. 68. The Fallacy is discovered, and the Snake in the Grass seen, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>So that we say, and that with very good ground; that it is no ways inconstant with this sound and unerring Principle, to affirm, that the Judgment of a certain Person or Persons, in certain Cases is Infallible, or for a certain Person, or Persons, to give a positive Judgment, and pronounce it as obligatory upon others; because the Foundation and Ground thereof, is not because they are Infallible, but because in these things, and at that time they were led by the Infallible Spirit: And <hi>Therefore</hi> it will not shelter any in this Respect, to pretend I am not bound to obey the Dictates of Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men; saying, is not this Popery. For there never will nor can be wanting in Case
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199413:11"/> of controversie, the Spirit of God to give Judgment through some or other in the Church of Christ, so long as any Assembly can properly, or in any tollerable Supposition be so termed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From which it is both clear and Plain from Matter of Fact. That the Quakers not only claim to themselves the Name of the Church, but also that Infallibility to themselves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that themselves are Infallible; and upon that foot, their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences upon their Disciples so pronounced, are Obligatory, and ought to be Indispensibly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, whether they be convinced of the Truth or Certainty of this their Judgment thus pronounced or no: And if this be not Rank Popery, I would fain know from <hi>George Whitehead</hi> what is; nor will their pretence to their being lead by the Spirit of God to give this Judgment be a <hi>Salvo;</hi> unless they can give a better Demonstration for their so saying, then their bare Affirmation; for that every Church may pretend to the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Guidance of the Spirit of God as well as the Quakers: And hence I conclude, that if the Infallible Quakers Church, impose any thing on their Disciples, by Vertue of their Infallible Authority, to be indispensibly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that she produce a miracle to confirm and ratifie both her Commission and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; or else grant that she own Infallibility in the same Sense the Papists do.</p>
                     <p>Again, that the Quakers account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the only Church; and as such Infallible,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199413:12"/> see <hi>Josiah Coal</hi>'s Works, p. 63. <q>The Infallible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the True Church, of which Christ, is the Supreme Head and Governour, I do not go about to deny: But that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Infallible; that I do deny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>By which 'tis manifest, that the Quakers and Papists do not disagree about the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Infallibility, and the power of their Sentences; and that the Disciples of each ought to obey whether they be perswaded in their Consciences of the Truth or Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Sentence or not: They only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer who of them twain be the Church: The one pretends to Miracles, so do the other; see the Papist Legends, and <hi>Fox</hi>'s Journal. And 'tis plain that the Quakers, as well as the Papists say, That the Sentence of their Church, whether by a single Person or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Assembled in Council, once pronounced is obligatory upon their Disciples, and not to be rejected as the Dictates of fallible Men; <q>For (say the Quakers as well as the Papists) There never will, nor can be wanting in Case of controversy, the Spirit of God to give Judgment through some or other in the Church, so long as any Assembly can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, or in any tollerable supposition be so termed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon these and the like Positions some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Quakers some Years since, charged the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers with holding Romish Principles, 1. That we are to believe as the Church believe, 2. That the Church cannot
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199413:12"/> err, 3. That She hath power to bind and loose (as <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> did acknowledge he had; See <hi>Tyranny and Hypocrisy detected,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 45. <hi>Friends, altho' I have not told it you, I do now declare it, I have power to bind and to loose whom I please</hi>) 4. That 'tis abominable Pride not to submit to her Judgment (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Church) She having always the Infallible Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which said 4 Positions <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate Incend.</hi> &amp;c. recites and very fairly vindicates them, read p. 16.17. <hi>viz.</hi> To the first I Affirm, <q>That the True Church is in the true Faith<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>1</hi> Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation tell you that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are by <hi>G.

                        </q> and proportionably he vindicates the other 3 Positions: But <hi>Rob. Barkly</hi> goes on in his Anarchy p. 42. say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <q>That as through our faithful Testimony in the Laws of the Lord, that Antichristian and Apostate Generation, the <hi>National Ministry</hi> hath received a <hi>Deadly Blow,</hi> by our discovering and witnessing against their forced Maintenance and Tythes, against which we have Testified by many cruel Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of all kinds, as our Chronicles shall make known to Generations to come: So that their Kingdom in the hearts of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, begin to totter and loose its Strength, and shall assuredly fall to the Ground: So
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199413:13"/> do we by coming to Righteousness, weaken the Strength of their Kingdom who judge for Reward—the Nation shall come to be disburthened of that deceitful Title of Lawyers, as well as Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding the Quakers deadly Blow which they Dream they have given the Priests and Lawyers; they neither shake nor totter, but do continue as strong and their Foundation is as firm as when they begun to Strike; So that their Prophecy and Chronicles seems to prove Abortive. But <hi>W. Rogers</hi> wrote a smart Book against this of <hi>Barkly's,</hi> Entituled <hi>The Christian Quakers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,</hi> &amp;c. which did strike a deadly Blow against the Quakers Image of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to which <hi>Thomas Ellwood,</hi> as <hi>R. Barkly</hi>'s Second, replyed by a Book stiled, <hi>An Antidote,</hi> &amp;c. where he saith p. 1. <q>I felt a just Indignation rise in my Soul against that unclean Spirit in <hi>(W. Rogers)</hi> which hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his Mouth in Blasphemy against the Truth and People of the Lord p. 152. and he unto whom all Power is given in Heaven and Earth, who is and will be with his Church to the End of the World, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now as well as then, given Gifts unto Men, and endowed them with Power from on high; invested some with an Heavenly Authority in the Truth, for the Edification and Preservation of the Body: There is the same reason and ground now to assert and vindicate the Authority and Power which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199413:13"/> God hath placed in his Church, as there was then; And this being done by the same Spirit, and in the same Manner now as it was then; Thou <hi>(W. Rogers)</hi> canst squirt no filth upon these <hi>(G. Fox &amp;c.)</hi> now which will not tend to bespatter them (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;) Take notice of that <hi>William,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it well, that all thy Revilings and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-Speeches against Friends in this day, do reflect as much upon the Apostles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Primitive Church as upon Friends <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 44. And this they <hi>(G. F. &amp;c.)</hi> have laboured to do both by Words and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; by Word of mouth as opportunity has offer'd, and where by Voice they could not, there they have done it by Papers or Epistles given forth in the Light. Thus did the Apostles in their days, where divine Epistles are hereby vilifi'd, as well as those of Friends; and they themselves no less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon p. 3. I know I touch a tender Point, and in a ticklish Time; wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Minds are possess'd with jealousies and fill'd with Surmisings p. 57. How dare you say that <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> hath taken upon him to give forth Directions and Instructions to others, when there are so many living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that what hath been given forth by him for Direction or Instruction to the Church, hath proceeded from the Spirit of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Again, <hi>Josiah Coal</hi>'s Works <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 93. All judgment (saith <hi>Coal</hi>) being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Light, that lighteth every
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199413:14"/> Man, the Light that is in every Man, must of necessity be the judge of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.</p>
                     <p>Reader, I have taken enough of <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Antidote, which is as strong-sented of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, as <hi>Rob. Barkly</hi>'s Anarchy; and yet neither of them exceed <hi>Josiah Coal:</hi> However they [like <hi>Ahabs</hi> false] Prophets all agree in their main Fundamentals. And I shall shew from thence how arrantly they vye it with the Apostles, who were divinely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired, and gifted with Miracles to confirm their Commission: For say the Quakers, you may as well reject the Epistles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles as theirs; Affirming, that if any squirt any filth upon <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> or the Quakers, it must inevitably fall upon the Apostles. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if any reject the Epistles of <hi>Geo. Fox,</hi> &amp;c. They consequently vilifie and reject St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles; and <hi>Coal</hi> gives a Reason for it too, <hi>viz.</hi> Whereas Christ said, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. <q>For the Father Judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment to the Son, 27.</q> And hath given him Authority to Execute Judgment also, <hi>Because</hi> he is the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> Matth. 28.18. And <hi>Jesus</hi> [who was Born of the Virgin] <hi>came</hi> and spake unto them say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>All Power</hi> is given unto Me, in Heaven and in Earth, so I say <hi>Coal</hi>'s Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all Judgment is committed to the Light, therefore the Light that is in the Quakers must be Judge of all Controversies. His Doctrine Teacheth, that all Judgment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199413:14"/> is committed to their Light: Their Light has Authority to execute Judgment, yea all Power in Heaven and Earth is given to their Light, and consequently their Light is the sole Iudge of all Controversy; and they the People whom this Light speaks through. And thus have they translated all Power and Authority, which was given to the Son of Man, Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to their Light, and so unhinged the whole Frame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christ's Church and Government, from his Commands and Precepts left on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ. <hi>Go ye therefore and Baptize,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When you pray, say after this manner; forgive us our Trespasses,</hi> &amp;c. Thus do they assert their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be the same with the Apostles; that their Light hath the same power to judge, to command, to give precepts, as Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Son of Man had: For to their Light, all power in Heaven and Earth is given: Oh Horrid Blasphemy! in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree. Again, see <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Antidote once more, p. 140. 141. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given him of the Lord. <q>Did he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp Authority? did he exercise a Power that belonged not unto him? doth he not say expresly, that the Lord had given it unto him? and wilt thou <hi>(William)</hi> charge him with falsehood? come, <hi>William,</hi> give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trifling, and speak out plain, either charge the Apostles with imposing upon the Churches, and cherishing an usurped Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199413:15"/> or fairly confess they had Power and Authority, Command and Rule, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by the Lord; for the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church: and if thou must grant it was so, then offer, at least, some shew or colour of Reason, why it may not be so now, or cease contending against it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having taken a large Proof, (unless I should quote their whole Books a thing impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) of the Quakers claim to the true Church, and the Order of it together, <hi>v z.</hi> Her Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority to Rule and Command, Judge and Pronounce Definitive Sentence as Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory on their Disciples, as the Commands of the Apostles of our Blessed Lord upon the Primitive Christians and all Succeeding Ages: It may not be amiss to recite the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>George Fox,</hi> the Quakers Lawgiver: I find <hi>Exodus</hi> the 20. <hi>Moses</hi> gave forth Ten Commandments: And <hi>George Fox,</hi> gave forth five, which the Quakers observe as strictly as the <hi>Jews</hi> ever observed those Ten of <hi>Moses</hi>'s giving forth, <hi>George Foxes</hi> are as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Thou shalt not pay Tythes to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Priests and Antichristian Impropriators.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thou shalt not be Married by or with a Priest.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thou shalt not put of thy Hat in Respect to thy Superiors.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thou shalt not shut up thy Shop on the Worlds Holy Days or Fast Days; according to the Worldly Magistrates Command.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thou shalt not pay towards the Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Steeple-houses, nor thy Tax towards the Trained Bands.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:199413:15"/>
                     <p>Now Reader, observe, there are two things on which the Quakers Church Hingeth; one is, their Church you see have as they dream, the same if not greater Power then that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles touching Church Government, Power to Rule, Authority to Judge, and Infallible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to Pronounce their Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, Excommunication or Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their Power Infatuated, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly Ignorant Disciples think themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to obey <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Laws and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and the Authority of their Churches also; that Scripture Commands are not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; for their Teachers have given them a Dispensation to break and violate them; but let me prove what I say: For the first, See <hi>William Penn</hi>'s <hi>Brief Examination and State of Lib. Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. p. 11. <q>And this I Affirm (saith <hi>William Penn</hi>) from the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I have receiv'd from God; not only that the Enemy is at work to scatter the Minds of Friends, by that loose Plea; what hast thou to do with me? Leave me to my Freedom and the Grace of God in my self, and the like; but this Proposition and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, as now understood and alledged, is a Deviation from, and a Perversion of the Ancient Principle of Truth; for this is the plain consequence of this Plea; if any one shall say, I see no Evil in paying Tythes to Hireling Priests; in that they are not claimed by Divine Right, but by the Civil
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199413:16"/> Laws of the Land I see no Evil, (saith a 2d) in Marrying by the Priests, for he is but a Witness; I see no Evil (saith a 3d) in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining a Publick Testimony in Suffering Times; or hiding in time of Persecution; for I have Christ's and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Example, I see no Evil (saith a 4th.) in Respecting Persons (by putting of my Hat to my Superiors) for whatever others do, I intend a sincere notice that I take of others, I know I see no Evil, (saith a 5th.) in keeping my Shop shut, upon the Worlds Holy Days, (or Fast Days.)</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Hinge, upon which their Church swing, and is founded, is in p. 47. of their Prophet, <hi>Edward Burrough's,</hi> viz. <q>That is no Command from God to me, what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to another; neither did any of the Saints, we Read of in Scripture, act by the Command, which was to another, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Command to themselves; I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to find an Example for it, they obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one their own Command <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> From whence 'tis plain; that Indispensible Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is required to the Laws, Orders, and Commands, pronounced by the Quakers Church; but as plain, that their Leaders have let their Disciples loose from obeying Scripture Commands, unless they have them anew; as the Inspired. Apostles had, or can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their Obedience, which will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be by their Teachers Doctrine; as I have at large shewed in my Book: <hi>The Quakers Set,</hi> &amp;c. p. 19. to 24. And having largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199413:16"/> that the Quakers claims a Power over the Consciences of their Disciples; and that they hold those four <hi>Romish</hi> Positions, which have enslaved Nations, destroyed Thousands, and is of a most Dangerous and Pernicious Consequence; namely, that we are to believe as the Church believes; that the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err; that she hath Power to Bind and Loose; that in all Cases of Controversie, we ought to submit to her Judgment; she having always the Infallible Spirit; which Pernicious Doctrines are closely concluded, and boldly asserted by the Quakers, which I shall briefly summ up under these 12 Heads, and then leave them as a suitable <hi>motto</hi> upon them: And then proceed to the next Chapter, where I hope to shew, that the Quakers Church is so far from being the true Church of Christ; that it is in very deed the most Formidable Heresies that hath risen up in the Church, since the Days of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Quakers are the Elect People of God, the only Church of Christ; amongst whom only is the Apostolick Order thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, and settled on it's Right Basis and Foundation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it's not Inconsistent with this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Church, to affirm that the Judgment of a certain Person or Persons, in certain Cases is Infallible, and being pronounced Obligatory on Believers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because their is not (say they) nor never will be wanting in the Church of Christ the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199413:17"/> Spirit of God to give Judgment, through some one, or more of them that is Infallible; and consequently, decisive in the Quaker Church.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And on that Supposition, none can squirt any Filth on <hi>George Fox,</hi> or the Quaker's Teachers; but it must fall upon and affect Christ's Apostles and Prophets.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Also thereupon, whoever reject the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles of the Quakers, Vilifie and Condemn the Epistles of the Holy Apostles.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They deny the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness; right, yet they own the Doctrine of Infallibility; and that they themselves are Infallible at least in Controversial Cases, and some other Cases, which shew that they would justle out the <hi>Pope</hi> to bring in the <hi>Fox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Whatever <hi>W. Rogers,</hi> &amp;c. speak against <hi>George Fox,</hi> &amp;c. equally Reflect on the Apostles.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That <hi>Thomas Eliwood</hi> was sensible he touched a Tender Point, and in a ticklish Time, in Asserting those <hi>Popish</hi> Positions, for which he is the less to be spared.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. And therefore peremptorily bid <hi>W. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> either charge the Apostles with usurping
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199413:17"/> Authority over the Consciences, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon the Churches by vertue of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; which would be Blasphemy, or else admit the Quakers may do the like to have the same Power, to exercise the same Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which would be equal Blasphemy; or like a Troop of Armed Men going by a Court of Judicature, and should violently take the Judge out of his Chare, in which he is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully plac'd, invested with Legal Power; and in his Room set up a Thief who stole a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Hour-glass, denied Christ Jesus, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Scriptures, despised the Magistrates, reproached his Ministers, and ought to be Tryed whether Guilty or not Guilty.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. That indispensable Obedience is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>G.

                     <p n="1">1. A Question to Professors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 27. <q>Is not the Substance, the Life, the Anointing called Christ, wherever it is found, doth not the Name (Christ) belong to the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and every member in the Body, as well as to the Head? — so that the name is not given to the Vessel, but to the Heavenly Treasure in the Vessel, p. 29. and did not the Word, who was made Flesh, dwell and appear in a Tabernacle of Flesh, and cause the Glory of his divine Flesh to shine through that earthly Flesh. — Is it not as necessary, that the Eternal Word be made Flesh inwardly, as it was for him to take on him an outward body of Flesh, p. 33. Now the Scriptures do expresly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between Christ and the Garment which he ware; between <hi>Him</hi> that came, and the <hi>Body</hi> in which <hi>He</hi> came: between the <hi>Substance</hi> which was Vail'd, and the <hi>Vail</hi> which Vail'd it: There was plainly <hi>He</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> in which <hi>He</hi> came; there was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:199413:20"/> the <hi>Outward Vessel,</hi> and the <hi>Inward Life.</hi> This we certainly know, and can <hi>Never</hi> call the bodily Garment Christ; but <hi>That</hi> which appeared and dwelt <hi>In</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Observe, that in all this, and much more in this Book, how the Quakers Doctrine and Testimony differ from that of the Angels, Luke 2.10.11. <hi>And the Angel said unto them fear not, for behold I bring you Tydings of great Joy, which shall be to all the people: for unto you is born this day, in the City of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. now him that was born of the Virgin, the Angel called Christ; but the Quakers cannot do so, but the Substance in that Body; likewise Acts 5.30. <hi>The God of our Fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a Tree; him hath God exalted with his right Hand, to be a Prince and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for to give Repentance to</hi> Israel, <hi>and forgiveness of Sins,</hi> Read <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38, 39. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. <hi>While they beheld a Cloud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him out of their sight,</hi> and so on: It was not the Light within which was hanged on a Tree, which Ascended in the visible sight of the <hi>Gallaleans;</hi> and that should so come in like manner: Oh no, it was the same that was born of the Virgin, which the blessed Angels, and holy Apostles did bear witness unto; not as the Quakers, who say the Name Christ belongs to every Believer, as well as to the Head; which they cannot call Christ but something in him, which is in themselves as they Dream; that was not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199413:21"/> born of <hi>Mary,</hi> that was not hanged on a Tree, that was not Crucified, Dead nor Buryed, nor nailed to the Cross; nor Run thorow with a Spear. This is the Quakers Christ. Thus do they, by their Doctrine and Testimony, acquit the <hi>Jews</hi> of crucifying Christ; which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sign they are not the true Church, in that they render the Apostles false witnesses.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Christian Quaker and his Div.</hi> &amp;c. p. 97. The Serpent is a Spirit: <q>Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bruise the Head of the Serpent, but something that is Internal and Spiritual, as the Serpent is; but if that Body of Christ (born of the Virgin) were the Seed, then could he not bruise the Serpents Head, in all, because, the Body of Christ is not so much as in any one<note n="†" place="margin">Yes by Faith.</note> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the seed of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is an holy and spiritual principle of Light, Life and Power; that being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Heart, bruiseth the Serpents Head; and because the Seed, <hi>which cannot be that Body,</hi> is Christ as the Scriptures testify.</q>
                        <hi>The seed is one, and that seed Christ, and Christ God over all blessed for ever.</hi> Observe, the Scriptures testify the contrary: They testify that the Body which was born of the Virgin, which was spit upon, which was nailed to the Cross, hanged upon the Tree, Dyed, Rose again and Ascended; which by a lively Faith dwelt in his Saints, was and is the Christ of God, the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> which was promised, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. And of this I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199413:21"/> could give a 100 Script. Proofs, see <hi>New Rome Arraigned,</hi> &amp;c. p. 55. to 66. Again, see <hi>W. Baily</hi>'s Works, p. 300. <q>A [Body] hast [Thou] prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red [Me] mark the distinction, [Thou] [Me] and a [Body] this [Me] that spake in the [Body] was the [Christ] p. 307. They [his Disciples] loved his Person for the sake of the frame and quality of the Spirit that dwelt in him, or else what was his Person to them more than another Person; but for that which dwelt in him, they loved him. Let none mistake me, I do not slight it, nor the Person of any of his Brethren or Children, as they are prepared to do the will of their Father.</q> Observe, still the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Quakers Teach to deny him to be Christ, who was born of the Virgin, hang'd on a Tree, Run thorow with a Spear. For if only that which speak through his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>viz.</hi> his Spirit, was the Christ of God; then are the Apostles found false Witnesses. and the <hi>Jews</hi> never crucified the Lord of Life and Glory: For the Quakers Light which they Dream to be Christ, was never cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nor buffeted, nor crown'd with Thorns, nor run thorow with a Spear: Besides, 'tis plain that they value his Body, only for the sake of the frame and temper of the Spirit that dwelt in it; otherwise, say the Quakers, what was his Person more than another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; Oh gross Blasphemy! What is this the true Church? No such matter, but the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of <hi>Satan:</hi> And to put all out of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199413:22"/> doubt, that the Quakers Church deny Christ, read <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Primmer p. 36. <q>

                        <q>Dear <hi>George Fox,</hi> who art the Father of many Nations; whose Life hath reached through us thy Children, even to the Isles afar off; to the begetting many again to a lively Hope; for which Generations to come, shall call thee Blessed; whose Being and Habitation, is in the Power of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; in which <hi>Thou Rulest</hi> and <hi>Governs</hi> in <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Thy</hi> Kingdom is Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Peace, and the Increase <hi>Thereof,</hi> is without end.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come <hi>George,</hi> you referr us to your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Testimony, to prove, that you are the Church of the First Born; but you are Condemned thereby, and found to be the False Church, the Mother of Harlots, and the Abomination of the Earth; in that you give Testimony to your Apostle, <hi>George Fox,</hi> and not to Christ Jesus; nay you rob Christ of his Divine Attributes, the Jewels of the true Church, and have decked, and therewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned your King <hi>George;</hi> for 'tis Christs Kingdom, that is Established in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; not <hi>George Foxes;</hi> 'tis Christ's Kingdom that shall have no end; not <hi>George Foxes;</hi> 'tis Christ's Kingdom that shall Increase; in which Christ himself Reigns in Righteousness, not <hi>George Fox,</hi> by all, which it appears, that the Quakers are not the Church of the First Born, of which, Christ Jesus is Head; but the Synagogue of the Self-righteous, and Self-exalted <hi>Pharasaical</hi> Church, of which,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199413:24"/>
                        <hi>George Fox</hi> was Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I remember, that <hi>Edward Burrows,</hi> in his Epistle saith, <q>And as concerning the Quakers; what do you say of them; you have seen their Conversation, and do they not walk Justly; are they not Meek, Humble, and Sober; do they not take much Wrong; compare them with the Scripture.</q> Answer, I have seen their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and when I come to treat of their Lives, I shall give an Answer. But <hi>Edward Burrows</hi> goes on. <q>Then being prepared of the Lord went forth, as commanded of the Lord, and the Word of the Lord we sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and did not spare, and caused the Deaf to hear, the Blind to see, and the Dread of the Lord went before us; and first of all, our Mouths were opened, and our Spirit filled with Indignation against the Priests and Teachers, and with them, and against them; <hi>First,</hi> we began to War, as being the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of the People to err, and against them, as the Fountain of all Wickedness, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Nations; and as being the Issue of Prophaneness; shewing unto all People, that they were not Lawful Ministers of Christ, sent of him, but were Deceivers and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs; and this was our first Work we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon, to thresh down the Deceivers, and lay them open, that all People might see their shame, and turn from them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well <hi>George,</hi> I see you can Magnifie your selves and boast of your Justice; your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Sobriety, and Meekness; and so might
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:199413:24"/> many of the <hi>Heathens;</hi> and perhaps with more reason, yet not the true Church of Christ, but I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, and Blasphemers, nevertheless, and so are you; you say you begun with the Priests, then they did not begin with you, that your first Work, was to thresh them down, to discover and lay them open, that all People might turn from them; yet all are not turned from them to the Quakers; no, nor of late, since you have been discovered and laid open, few have turned to you, but many have left you, and begin to make War with you, and to thresh you, and lay you open, that People may leave you, and this angers you; well, but let us see ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your Idolizing Pamphlets, Wrote by one of your Humble, Meek, and Sober Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, wherein, he like <hi>Josiah Coal,</hi> aforesaid, most Blasphemously Attributes that to <hi>George Fox,</hi> due only to Christ, <hi>The Quakers Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,</hi> &amp;c. p. 6. <q>Stand up <hi>Muggleton</hi> the Sorcerer, whose Mouth is full of Cursing, Lies, and Blasphemy, who calls thy last Book a Looking Glass, for <hi>George Fox,</hi> whose Name thou art not worthy to take in thy Mouth, who <hi>Is</hi> a Prophet indeed, and hath been faithful in the Lord's Business from the beginning: It was said of Christ, that he was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not; <hi>So</hi> it may be said of this true Prophet, <hi>George Fox,</hi> whom <hi>John</hi> said he was not; but thou will feel this <hi>Prophet</hi> one day, as heavy as a Milstone upon thee; and although the World knows him not, yet he is known.</q>

                     <p>Come <hi>George,</hi> what think you of this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of yours, that say Christ was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not; and <hi>So</hi> it may be said, by <hi>George Fox;</hi> what <hi>George,</hi> do you think that this Blasphemous Testimony will prove the Quaker Church, the Church of Christ; I tell you nay, you must first condemn these your Blasphemous Books, or else you will be made War with from Age to Age, and threshed from Generation to Generation; I must confess, he was one of your Prophets and great Teachers, and I know you are so much the loather to condemn his Books:</p>
                     <p>For, 1st. It was this, <hi>Sol. Eccles.</hi> which told that great Lie, in the Name of the Lord; saying, this Year, shalt thou <hi>John Story</hi> dye, who at that time was ill, yet lived about four Years after.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He, in the same false Prophecy, avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Womens Meetings to be the Ordinances of Christ, when <hi>George Fox</hi> Ordained them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This was he, that burnt his Fiddles on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This was he, yea even he, that went to <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair stark naked, <hi>viz.</hi> a pan of Coals on his Head.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This is he, who in his Musick Lecture said, p. 22. <hi>viz.</hi> 'I do affirm, that if <hi>John</hi> (the Apostle) had said he had been a Sinner, he had lyed.</p>
                     <p>Yet the very same <hi>John,</hi> hath left it upon Record; that if we say, we have no Sin, we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:199413:25"/> deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us, and that if we say, we have not Sinned, we make him (Christ Jesus) a lyer, and his Word is not in us, and the same <hi>John,</hi> was out of those Disciples, whom the Lord Christ Taught to Pray; <hi>Forgive us our Trespasses.</hi>

                     <p>Yea, this is he, who says, in the Quakers Challenge, p. 3. <q>That the Quakers are in the Truth, and none but they.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this considered, 'tis not likely, that the Quakers will condemn the Infallible Meetings of such a Son of their Synagogue, much more of this nature I could collect; but having largely handled this Blasphemous part of their Doctrine and Testimony, in <hi>New Rome Arraigned,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>The Quakers Set,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Come <hi>George Whitehead;</hi> I have shewed how you deny Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and Idolize each other, in and by your Doctrine and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and by both, it appears to me, that you are not the True Church; but since 'tis a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of your own prescribing, I am willing to peruse it according to your own Terms, in proposing it, and when I have fully proved you not to be what you pretend you are, then let others judge; I hope this will account fair Dealing.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:199413:27"/> will lay aside their Gowns, throw away their Bibles and turn Quakers; and that our Legislators, who not rightly understanding your Principles and Practices have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd you, will make Laws to defend you, and protect you; for if (as <hi>G. W.</hi> says) that which is spoken from the Spirit of Truth in any; and to be sure he means Quakers, (for they deny any other People to be a true Church, read <hi>Judas and the Jews</hi> p. 26.) be of more Authority than the Bible, what profit is it to read it? truly none; 'tis Conjuration by their Doctrine above told: and if so we may (as <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> says) even burn them, for we see, according to the Quakers Creed, the Scriptures are but Dust and dead Serpents Food; yea, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> all Dust, all Death, all Serpents Food; nay moreover, so uncertain (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Quakers Doctrine and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) that whether <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Hermes</hi> be the first Pen-man of Sacred Writ, remains doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them, and they would make it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others; still suggesting, that some of it was spoke by the grand imposture; some by wise Men ill apply'd, but what part of it I do not know; some by good Men ill expressed, neither know I that part; some by false Prophets, and yet true, neither know I that part; some by true Prophets, and yet false, neither know I that part. So that the Quakers Church has left us quite in the dark, and is very unintelligible: And 'tis plain that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:199413:27"/> this sort of Reasoning, of which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but a hint, tends to overthrow the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, and to take away the divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures; for take away what is received in the Holy Scripture, what was spoke by wicked and good Men, by Prophets true and false; and I would fain know what part of it they have left.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>George,</hi> that you may have a fair hearing and a legal Tryal, according to your own proposed Method; whether you be the Church of the first born; since you have told us how to try you and measure you, let us know what you say of your own Writings, Epistles, and Books, for we have had a fair Sample of your Sayings of, and Judgment concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Scriptures, which being compared with your never Reading a Chapter or an Epistle of the Old or New Testament in any of your Religious Meetings (if so I may call them without offence to Christian Ears) do sufficiently shew that you deny the Scriptures, and consequently cannot be the Church of the first Born. Come <hi>George</hi> I first shewed your contempt of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> 2dly. applauding and idolizing each other to a high Degree of Blasphemy, 3dly.

Penn</hi>'s Book. <hi>The Christian Quaker,</hi> &amp;c. p. 69. And that must be their meaning, or else why should the greatest Teachers amongst them say, they were before all Languages were, which is many Thousands of Years since; and why should they say they were before all Disputes and Arguments were? which was before the Herds-men of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot;</hi> and that they were come to the end of all Disputes which is not yet fulfilled: But their Blasphemy is manifest, and Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s Book, above quoted, clears the Point.</p>

And they [the Quakers] can discern who are Saints, who are Devils, and who are Apostates, without speaking ever a word, they that be in the Power and the Life of Truth.</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>Come Friend <hi>George,</hi> I think I have taken enough to shew you in your proper Colour, far out-striping <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks that ever I Read of, for Self-exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is no sign of your being the Church of the first Born; but a large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You see <hi>G. Fox</hi> takes to himself the Voice from Heaven, John 12.28. <hi>Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify thy Name; Then came there a voice from heaven saying, I have both glorifyed it and will glorify it again,</hi> 29. <hi>the people said it thundered, others that an Angel spake to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Next you see <hi>Fox</hi> pretend to write from the Mouth of the Lord; and is not asham'd to say that he is Naked, nay, that he stands Naked, Clothed only with Righteousness; his Name is not known in the World; nay, so impudent was this Imposture, that he said in the 3d. Instance, that the World neither knew him nor his name, when there was not Ten Men in the County known better: Oh blush and be asham'd for ever, you Infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Quakers, that can thus swallow any thing; for either these sayings are <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s, as laid down by me, or they are not; if they are not, why do you not meet me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my proposition? and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as <hi>G. W.</hi> pretended to the Parliament, that I wrong you in Charge, Citation or Observation. If they be, why do you not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:199413:29"/> Renounce these Heretical and Blasphemous Principles; and let the Nation know that you disown and reject them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Next you see, that <hi>Fox</hi> pretends to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with God; saying, that he hath the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the Dead, is equal with God; which Spirit, the Quakers in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral own they have; oh, Blasphemy in the highest Nature.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. You also see, that <hi>Fox</hi> tells you, he was before all Languages were, and that to him, they are no more then Dust; that is, no more then the Scriptures are; oh, you miserable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Souls, call'd Quakers; what are you quite blind, are you given up to strong Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; do not you perceive in all <hi>Whitehead's</hi> Answers; he takes no notice of most of my Remarkable Instances of your Rank Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Come you the Hearers amongst the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; if there be but one grain of Sense remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you, tell me; do you think that <hi>James Parnell</hi> was before all Disputes and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; was he before the Dispute between the Herdsmen of <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> tell me; do not pin your Faith upon <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s Sleeve; if he tell you he was, do not believe him; for either he was, or was not; if he was, prove it to the World; if he was not, declare him an Imposture; deny his Doctrine, and publickly condemn his Book, so may you acquit your selves, and silence the Pens against you, and continue the Favour of the Government.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:199413:30"/>7. Come <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> are you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd to be found vindicating such horrid Blas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemies and vile Imposters, come answer me; have you such a gift of discerning, as to know who are Saints, who are Devils, and who are Apostates, without speaking ever a Word; <q>for you either have, or have not; if you have, why did you Write in <hi>Caters Narrative,</hi> viz. <hi>G. Smith,</hi> of <hi>Little Port,</hi> hath been convinced about 13 or 14 Years; and <hi>Ever Since</hi> he came amongst us, hath walked <hi>Ʋprightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi> to his <hi>Measure,</hi> and have been of a <hi>Blameless Conversation from his Youth,</hi> p. 19.</q> If you have not; why do you thus boast in your proud Self-exaltation, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude many well meaning People, who think all you speak and Write is from the Eternal Spirit, and thereby so Infallibly led, that none as in the 8th. Instance, need to give you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning or judgment, when alass, I can give you 100 Instances of your manifest Fallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dangerous, as well as gross Mistakes: And thus much briefly, to shew you as in a Glass, your manifest Hypocrisie, grand Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and false Doctrine, which shew you are not the Church of the First Born.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and lastly on this Head, I am now about to shew you the Tender Care you have to preserve the Reputation and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your own Books, Papers and Epistles, not a Word of calling them Dust, Death, and Serpents food; not a word of calling them Beastly Ware, the Chaff, the Husk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Your
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:199413:30"/> frequent Epistles you give to the Scriptures, not a word of what was spoken by Good Men, to be ill expressed by Wise Men, ill applied, no such matter; and first, let us see the care at your <hi>London</hi> Convocation, 1675.</p>

I have 2 Epistles from the <hi>London</hi> Convocation, and shall recite part of them, as a further Proof of their blind Zeal, as if the Holy Scriptures were defective and not proper to spread Truth; but to the said E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles; and then after some brief Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall conclude this Chapter, touching the Quakers two Points, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Doctrine and Testimonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>For more of this Nature, with the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Consequences attending their Practice, see my Book, the Quakers set in their true Light; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 20. to p. 47.</p>
                     <p>Reader, I am willing to give a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature of their Epistles; and the Titles; and the Reason why I enlarge thereupon. The 1st. Epistle was from the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:199413:34"/> yearly Meeting 1675. wherein they are plain and positive, that their Papers are given forth by Divine Inspiration, and as such; and that they arrantly guard against such slight Names and Expressions, as Edicts, Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are Names and Titles Honourable enough for all humane Writings: But the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures you see, the very same Men can call Dust, Death, carnal Letter, beastly Ware, Serpents Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet have they the Impudence to say they value the Bible above all Books extant: And as to the 2d. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry title carries the Picture of a Quaker; for who but such a one, void of all Modesty and Charity, could have given out a non sensical Paper as a Message from the Lord Christ; when there is scarce a Sentence in the whole that Teach any point of Doctrine relating to the Fundamentals of the Christian Religion; telling the Ministers they are Witches, and in Witchcraft a Cage of unclean Birds; that God is calling People from thence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay observe the universality; it was to go thro' the World. Surely had the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> accepted of the Quakers new Service-Book, after the Bible was Condemned by the Quakers; and <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Sentenced to be only Dust, Death, and Serpents Meat; we should have had new Bibles, a new Liturgy, a new Religion, a new Gospel, yea, and a new sort of Ministers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oo. See New <hi>Rome Arraign'd, &amp;c.</hi> p. 43. for more of this. As to the 3d. We must observe, that was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:199413:35"/> to go amongst the Quakers, for it is so Entituled, <hi>viz. This is only to go amongst Friends.</hi> And indeed it's fit to go amongst no other People; for it's very plain that they put the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for the Town of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the branch the Star, the Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: They most Wretchedly and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously attribute to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> who rose out of the <hi>North</hi> as abovetold, and at large in his Book, <hi>News coming up, &amp;c.</hi> For all those Scriptures which mention the Branch, the Star, the Son of Righteousness, the Town of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> they all refer to Christ, for to him give all the Prophets witness, and not to <hi>Geo. Fox,</hi> read <hi>Luke</hi> 10.34. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17, 19. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.8. cap. 6. v. 12. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2. and to this agree St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.6. Neither will this peace of Blasphemy seem strange to such as are acquainted with the wild Doctrine of the Quakers; for the whole Epistle which contains 24 pages in Quarto, hath little or nothing in it, but a parcel of affected Rhetorick, senseless and useless; for if the Quakers were forced to interpret it, and explain their meanings; they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it either relates to the inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward State of Mankind: If they say the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then 'tis desperate, and seems to be only calculated for the use and service of the Fifth Monarchy-Men: If they say they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it all inward, then 'tis such Nonsense and <hi>Bedlam</hi>-Stuff as the like never was heard; what Heaven and Hell within the Trumpets,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:199413:35"/> the Swords, the Mountains, the Spears, Ox and Ass, Rocks and Valleys, Fish, Tares, Chaff, Dung and Mire, all within; what Miracles, Fish and Net, all within; I am more large on this Subject in <hi>New Rome Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd.</hi> But before I go further let me add an Abstract of a Letter, sent from <hi>John Aud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> out of the West of <hi>England,</hi> which may lead us to believe, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers did believe the North of <hi>England</hi> was the Town of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and that the Branch the Star, the Son of Righteousness were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to their Prophet <hi>Fox. viz.</hi>
                        <q>Dear and Precious One, in whom my Life is bound up, and my Strength in thee stands; by thy Breathings I am nourished, by thee my Strength is renewed, blessed art thou for evermore; and blessed are all they that enjoy thee: Life and Strength comes from thee, Holy One; —dayly do I find thy presence with me, which doth exceedingly preserve me, for I cannot Reign but in thy Presence and Power. — Pray for me that I may stand in thy Dread for evermore — I am thine, begotten and nourished by thee; and in thy Power am I preserved, Glory unto thee, Holy One, for ever.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as to the Titles of the other Epistles, some were only to go amongst the Quakers, particularly the 4<seg rend="sup">th.</seg> And having in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Books enlarged on this Head, I shall only remind the Reader what horrid Names and contemptible Expressions they cast upon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:199413:36"/> the Scriptures; and to confirm to us their dis-esteem of them; they did never read, nor do they yet read any one Chapter in their Religious Assemblies (if I may call them so) and you see how frequent they read their own; yea, <hi>G. Fox</hi> Charges and Commands them to read his Epistle, and that too, as the Word of the Lord God: All which shew that the Quakers are not <hi>the Church of the first Born,</hi> but such a Tribe of Hypocrites and false Pretenders as never appeared since the days of <hi>Simon Magus:</hi> This is the Charge I give them, and stand ready to prove them guilty of the Errors contained in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; to which let me subjoyn a word of Use and Application.</p>

                     <p>THere are four things proposed by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, by which they are willing to be Tryed and Measured, whether they be not the Church of the First-born; namely, by their Doctrine, by their Testimony, by their Lives, and by their Sufferings. The two first I have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:199413:37"/> gone through, and shewed that by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they deny Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the Christ of God; that they deny the Scriptures by their Contempt cast upon them; as calling them Death, Dust, Beastly Ware, Serpents Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that by their Testimony, they agree not with the Prophets of old, <hi>Acts</hi> the 10th. 43 <q>To him [Christ] gave all the Prophets Witness; that through his Name, whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, shall receive Remission of Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither <hi>do the Quakers Testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Holy Angels,</hi> Luke <hi>2.10.11.</hi> And the Angel said unto them, fear not, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I bring you good Tidings of great Joy, which shall be to all People: For unto you is born <hi>This Day,</hi> in the City of <hi>David,</hi> a Saviour, which is Christ the <hi>Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Neither <hi>do the Quakers Testimony agree with the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> Acts <hi>5.30.</hi>

                        <q>The God of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a Tree; him hath God exalted with his right Hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repentance to <hi>Israel,</hi> and Forgiveness of Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <hi>Neither</hi> do the Quakers Testimony agree with the Martyrs, <hi>Acts</hi> and Mon. p. 610. <q>I am come hither (said Dr. <hi>Barnes</hi>) to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as an <hi>Heretick;</hi> hearken to my Faith: I <hi>Believe</hi> in the Holy and Blessed Trinity; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Christ Jesus suffered Thirst, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           </note>
                        </q> For first, the Quakers give Testimony to <hi>George Fox,</hi> as the Branch, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:199413:38"/> Star, the Son of Righteousness, and put the North of <hi>England,</hi> for the Town of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> And whereas 'tis plain, that the Blessed Angels, Holy Apostles and Martyrs Testified to a Christ that was born in the City of <hi>David,</hi> that was hanged on a Tree; that suffered Thirst, Hunger, Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Quakers plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say; that this is not the Christ: See <hi>The Christian Quaker, and his Div.</hi> &amp;c. p. 98. But on the contrary, they bear Testimony to their Light to be Christ which was not born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> at the Town of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and City of <hi>David;</hi> was not hanged on a Tree, pierced with a Spear, Crowned with Thorns; did never suffer Hunger, Cold, nor Thirst; and that the Trinity is only Imaginary, and by them rejected. And since their Testimony and Doctrine, thus differ from the Testimony and Doctrine of the Glorious Angels, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Holy Apostles, and Blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and all Christian Churches to this day. I do thereupon conclude, the Quakers are not the Church of the First Born; but a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heresie lately risen: But that <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> may not complain of not having a full Hearing, and his Witnesses heard. I shall go on, God willing, with his other two Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; namely, the Quakers Lives and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; but first their Lives, which I must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into two parts. First, their Lives, as Christians, (since so they would be accounted) Respecting their Obedience to the Christian Doctrine, Precepts and Commands. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:199413:38"/> with Respect to their Holy Living, which they think exceed all the World; besides, else why should they give it as an Evidence of their being <hi>The Church of the First Born;</hi> since many <hi>Heathens,</hi> respecting their Conversation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed most of the Quakers. But one thing the Quakers forgot; for they have a 5<seg rend="sup">th.</seg> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; namely, their Miracles Recorded in <hi>Foxes</hi> Journal; but that would have been like the rest: For as the Apostles wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Name of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth; Fox</hi> wrought his Miracles in his own Name, like <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> So that had they produced their Miracles as an Evidence of their being the Church of the First Born; it would like the other four, have been a means to have proved the quite contrary; but to the matter.</p>
                     <p>Christ Jesus to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is committed; who is Head and Law giver to his Church, gave forth several Commands and Precepts; and did in the days of his Flesh Institute and Ordain the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptisme and the Lord's Supper; and told us how and after what manner to Pray. Now if the Lives and Practices of the Quakers do evidence to the World that they are found in the practice of the same; then it will be a sign, that they may be admitted to be a Church, tho' not the only Church, since many Christians are found in the practice of them: But on the other hand, if the Quakers shall continue to say we are divinely Inspired as well as the Apostles, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:199413:39"/> have the same Power, Rule, Command as they had; and our Writings are given forth by the Eternal Spirit, as Infallible as St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and that if any squirt any filth upon us it will be spatter the Apostles; and if any reject our Epistles, they vilifie the Apostles, for we are inspired as well as they: We can give forth Commands, Exhortations and Precepts all well as they, for all Judgment is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Light in us, yea, all Power in Heaven and in Earth; and we can work Miracles as well as they; and therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will reckon us the only Church of Christ (as we would be accounted or only one of the Protestant Churches; it's all one we will not come under the Power of your Scripture Commands; for one of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles have laid it down for Infallible Doctrine, see <hi>Edward Burrow's Works</hi> p. 47. <q>That is no Command from God to me, what he Commands to another, neither did any of the Saints which we read of in Scripture, act by the Command which was to another; not having the Command to themselves; I challenge to find an example of it: They o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed every one their own Command, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:199413:39"/> unreasonable in a Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> So that tho' our Leaders require of us submissive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Laws; and that we ought to believe as our Church believes, yet they have left us at Liberty from the Jurisdiction of your Scripture Commands, and we not being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Water-Baptisme is commanded, Matth. 28.19, 20. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and lo I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, even to the end of the world.</hi> Again, Luke 22.19, 20. <hi>And he took bread and gave thanks, and brake it and gave unto them say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is my body given for you: Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> And tho' we find this literally commanded, yet our Teachers tell us that the Scriptures are Dust, Death, beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ware, Serpents Meat; and that unless our Light, to whom all Judgment in Heaven and Earth is committed, and is the sole judge of all Controversies, convince us we are not concluded, and thereupon we reject them as beggerly Elements. And moreover, our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers tell us they are Deceivers and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers that tell us of a Sacrament, and for which they ought to Blush and Tremble; And that Water-Baptisme is an Institution which rose from the Whore of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the practice of it is Idolatry, as in <hi>News coming up,</hi> p. 34. <hi>Burrow's Works,</hi> p. 51. 518. <hi>Smith s Primmer,</hi> p. 36. <hi>A Musick Lecture,</hi> p. 25.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:199413:40"/> And these Arguments, nor our Light within do convince us; and thereupon we reject them, and do neither Baptize with Water, nor Receive the Sacrament; And this we are not ashamed to proclaim to all the World, both by our Doctrine, Testimony, our Lives, Practice and Conversation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To all which I thus Answer, in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, That these Commands are plain and positive; and without which you cannot be the Church of the First Born, but will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and cast; neither am I alone in this my Sentence, read the History of the <hi>French</hi> Protestants, Entituled <hi>Synodicon in Gallia Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formata,</hi> p. 16. Article 37. 38. <q>We do believe that both in Baptism and the Lord's Supper God doth indeed truly, and effectually give whatsoever he doth there Sacramentally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit; and therefore we do conjoyn with the Signs, the true possession and enjoyment of what is offered to us in them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do affirm, that they which do bring pure Faith as a clean Vessel unto the Holy Supper of the Lord; they do indeed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that which the signs do there witness, <hi>That is,</hi> that the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ are no less the Meat and Drink of the Soul, than Bread and Wine are the Meat and Drink of the Body: We say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let the Element of Water be never so despicable; yet notwithstanding, it doth truly witness unto us the inward Washing of our Souls with the Blood of Jesus Christ,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:199413:40"/> by the Vertue and Efficacy of his Spirit; and that the Bread and Wine being given us in the Lord's Supper, do serve in very deed unto our Souls nourishment, because they do as it were point out to us with the Finger, that the Flesh of Jesus Christ is our Meat, and his Blood our Drink, by and through the Vertue and Efficacy of his Blessed Spirit; and we reject those [preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Churches] as will not receive such signs and marks. Again, p. 12. ibid. Article 28. In this Belief we protect, that where the Word of God is not received, and where there is no professed subjection to it; and where there is no use of the Sacraments; if we will speak properly, we cannot think there is any [true] Church.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come <hi>G. W.</hi> What think you now? What starting hole have you in store? And what have you more to say for your selves, why Sentence of Condemnation should not be pronounced against your being the Church of the First Born; you see the Commands of Christ, the Practice of the Apostles, Primitive Christians, Saints and Martyrs, in all Ages stand Witness against you and your Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Practices.</p>
                     <p>Again, all Christian Churches, since the Days of Christ, have frequently in their Prayers to God, made Confession of their Sins, and beg'd Pardon for Jesus Christ his sake: This I am sure no Christian will deny; for so hath Christ Taught us in that most
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:199413:41"/> Excellent Form of Prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. saying, <q>
                           <hi>When you Pray say after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> Our Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> forgive us our sins as we forgive them that trespass against us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> But the Quakers do not Pray after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for they make no Confession of Sins to God, nor beg pardon for Christ's Sake, neither in their publick Prayers in Meetings, nor is there such an Expression to be found in all their Books; if any think I wrong the Quakers herein, let them read and search as I have done, and shew me such a passage if they can: I have read great part of the Books following, besides many others; And also, I was more than 25 Years a Member of their Society, and I can neither remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor yet find in the Books following such a passage, which are these,

                     <p>Reader, I have given you a tolerable sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Books which I have searched, yea and many more, yet I cannot find such a passage; and therefore if thou art a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and have but a spark of Christianity
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:199413:41"/> left in thee, I admonish thee, nay I intreat thee to consider of these Scriptures fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>John 1.8. <hi>If we say we have no sin we deceive our selves and the truth is not in us,</hi> v. 9. <hi>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Psalm 38.18. <hi>For I will declare mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; I will be sorry for my sins,</hi> 51.1. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness, according unto the multitude of thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies blot out my transgressions,</hi> v. 2. <hi>Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sins,</hi> v. 3. <hi>for I acknowledge my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and my sin is ever before me,</hi> read <hi>Psalm</hi> 40.15.</p>
                     <p>Isa. 64.6. <hi>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind hath taken us away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lam. 3.20. <hi>Let us lift up our hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens, we have transgressed and have rebelled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Job 7.20. <hi>I have sinned, what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Prov. 20.9. <hi>Who can say I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eccles. 7.20. <hi>For there is not a just man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, that doth good and sinneth not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nehem. 1.6. <hi>Let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open, that thou may'st hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:199413:42"/> day and night for the children of Israel, thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and confess the sins of the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael which we have sinned against thee, both I and my fathers have sinned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dan. 9.4, 5, 20, 23. <hi>And I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession, and said, O Lord, we have sinned, and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts, and from thy judgments; and whilest I was speaking and praying, and eonfessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord my God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus doth it appear, that <hi>David</hi> a Man after God's own Heart, and <hi>Daniel</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the Lord; yea the holy Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, and many other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, even as many as wrote in his Name, thought not themselves too good, nor too holy, nor too righteous to acknowledge their Transgressions, and to confess their Sins to God Almighty, thereby acknowledging his Sovereignty over them, and the justice of his Laws and Judgments: But the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers like the Pharisee in the Gospel, <hi>Luke</hi> the 18.10. boast themselves of a sinless Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when God knows they are but like other Men, as all Cities and Towns where they live, and with whom they deal, know right
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:199413:42"/> well; tho' they like the ancient Hereticks, the Donatists and Pelagians, profess a sinless Perfection, who as I have read, concluded that a constant practice of confession did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a constant course of sinning, to whom St. <hi>Augustin</hi> excellently answered<note n="†" place="margin">Aug. in Ps. <hi>99.</hi>

                        <hi>Confess always, for thou hast matter always to confess.</hi> He (saith St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>) is taught that he sins daily, who is taught to pray daily for the remission of his Sins [St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>] on the Lord's Prayer, who lived 250 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ.</p>

This Prayer being ended, he goes on in the next page saying, <q>verily, when the new Testament was first set forth by <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> — I bought it by the providence of God, and at the first reading, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I chanced upon this sweet Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. It is a true saying, and worthy of all Men to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced; that Christ Jesus came into the World to save sinners, of whom I am the chief and principal. This one Sentence thro' God's instruction did so exhilarate my Heart, being before wounded with the guilt of <hi>my Sin;</hi> — And therefore <hi>with all my whole Power I teach,</hi> that <hi>all</hi> Men should first acknowledge their sins and condemn them,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:199413:43"/> and afterwards Hunger and Thirst after Righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus Reader, you may perceive that it was the practice of the Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs, to confess their Sins to God; but read 500 of the Quakers Pharasaical Books, wherein there are divers Prayers, and you shall not find an Expression of that nature, <hi>G. Keith</hi> (who still bears that name, tho' he is separated from them and their Errors) excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: I have <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Book, <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Fixed</hi> by me; wherein there is a Prayer, containing near 5 Pages, but not a word of that nature; but like the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> applauds himself, and disdains others; saying, <q>Thou knowest O Lord, that thou hast endued me with a Christian Spirit, and with Faith, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Rejoycing under all my Sufferings; yet thou hast endued me with a Spirit of Righteous, Judgment, Understanding, and Zeal for thy Holy Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here he tells the World, as well as God, that he hath a Righteous Judgment, a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Understanding, and a Righteous Zeal; yea, a Christian Spirit and Patience, and he goes on, without any confession of Sin, or any thing of that nature; no, that's below him: It is enough for such Men as <hi>Isaiah, Job, Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, David, John</hi> the Evangelist, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, and other Apostles, Prophets, and Martyrs, to make such Addresses, and not for such high grown <hi>Pharisees</hi> as the Quakers; who
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:199413:43"/> say, they know who are Saints, who are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and who are Apostates, without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever a word; and that they are furnished at all times, on all occasions, and in all cases, with discerning and judgment: Insomuch, that they need no Man to give them discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or to inform their Judgments; for they pretend always to be ready furnished, see their Book, <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> &amp;c. p. 58. Where they teach this Doctrine, suitable to <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s Prayer; who therein say, in his own Commendation, that he hath a Righteous Judgment, a Righteous Understanding, a Righteous Zeal; and the like may be said of the Prayers of <hi>Stephen Crisp, Richard Ashly, W. Bingly,</hi> and others, whose Papers are Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the end of their Sermons. In a word, your laying aside the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, the Apostles Creed, and the like Christian Practices; not only wholly in your Meetings for Worship, but generally in private Families; is a proof, that you are not the Church of the First Born. And to perform my Task, in the second part proposed; I shall transcribe the Cage formerly made, and I hope they will not only see themselves thereby, not be the Church of the First Born; but be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and not think themselves all perfect; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so when they consider, that they call the Church of <hi>England</hi> a Cage of Unclean Birds. They will not be angry with me, for I shall lay Perfection, and Imperfection together, the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and the <hi>Publicans,</hi> heaps upon heaps;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:199413:44"/> and if they cannot see themselves to be such; if they desire it, I shall give them a Key to open the Cage, where they may see their greatest Writers, and chief Speakers, guilty of such Crimes, as the <hi>Heathen</hi> would be ashamed of. I remember how <hi>George Fox,</hi> use to Preach the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be the Cage of Unclean Birds; saying, their Note was <hi>no perfection here:</hi> And now let them see what perfection there is in the Cage, wherein I have put them; and so I shall conclude this Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, is fallen, and is become the Habitations of Devils, and the Hold of every foul Spirit, and a Cage of every unclean and hateful Bird; for her Sins have reached to Heaven, and God hath remembered her Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity's, reward her even as she hath rewarded you, and double unto her double, according to her Works, in the Cup which she hath filled, fill to her double; rejoyce over her thou Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ye Holy Apostles and Prophets; for God hath avenged you on her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2.5.6.20.</p>

                        <l>If not, why should you not confession make,</l>
                        <l>And pardon beg, for Jesus Christ his sake.</l>
                        <l>Are you too proud, or do you still disdain;</l>

                        <l>Behold I say, and view the Prophets well;</l>
                        <l>They did confess; the Scripture doth us tell,</l>
                        <l>Their Sins to God, and beg'd his Pardon too:</l>
                        <l>If you were humble, you would do so too.</l>

                        <l>I say behoid, how groveling they do lye,</l>
                        <l>And cross, yea, cross, all cross to all, and why</l>
                        <l>No Man can tell, nor they a reason give;</l>
                        <l>Why they so cross should be to all that live.</l>
                        <l>Pretences great, they to Religion make,</l>
                        <l>Tho' cross to all, some think for crosness sake.</l>
                        <l>In practice cross, yea in their Fruits also;</l>
                        <l>In Manners cross, in Faith and Doctrine too.</l>
                        <l>Cross to the Saints, cross to the Prophets too;</l>
                        <l>Yea cross to all, till they themselves undo:</l>

                        <l>Will still persist; their Errors not retract.</l>

                     <head type="sub">Shews that the Sufferings of the Quakers do not demonstrate them to be the Church of the first Born.</head>
                     <p>COme <hi>George,</hi> I am now come to the best spoke in your Wheel, yea, the best Flower in your Garland, and in which your chief glorying has stood; boasting over other Dissenters, who had some regard to Magistracy as God's Ordinance; and thereupon walked wisely, and submitted to the Law and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Man for the Lord's Sake, and followed the example of good and holy Men, according to the Doctrine of Christ, who said if they persecute you in one City, flee to the next; and this St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> was sensible of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:199413:47"/> when he made his escape from the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> which was beset with Armed Soldiers, and for which he made a Learned and Christian Apology, see <hi>Eccles. Hist. of Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes Schol.</hi> lib. 3. fol. 299. 300. which said Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is Authorised by both precept and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Examples of the holy Prophets, Christ and his Apostles; part of which I have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my Book, <hi>The painted Harlot both Stript and Whipt,</hi> &amp;c. p. 65. 66. But Friend <hi>George</hi> I would not have you compare your Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the Sufferings of the Apostles and Martyrs, for they suffered for obeying the Doctrine of Christ Jesus, and you for your Humour. And now after all if your Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, of which you so much boast (as that you gave it as one proof of your being the Church of the First Born) should prove coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit; what will you say? How will you come off? Where will you hide your Head? That for this 40 Years have been Writing in the defence of such horrible Errors. <hi>George</hi> you cannot go from your Post; you must either defend your Errors or retract them; and so I shall proceed to examine your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, give them their due weight, and you a full hearing; and wait your answer.</p>
                     <p>That every suffering is not persecution, all knowing Men will readily grant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be necessary, in the handling this point, to shew what persecution is, which according to my small Tallent, I shall do briefly thus.</p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:199413:48"/>
                     <p>Persecution, I take to consist in these two things, first, when a Man is forc'd by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to decline and forsake Worshiping the true God, in that way prescribed in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures; which is to renounce the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith and Worship, under pain of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, Fines, Banishment or Death; or some other Sanguinary, or Pecuniary Pains, or Penalties: This all will grant to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, who professes and understand the Truth of the Christian Religion. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to compell Men against their Consciences, to Worship and do Sacrifice to false Gods, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, or Graven Images, under the like Pains and Penalties, aforesaid; this also is Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prove the first, Read <hi>Acts</hi> the 4.1, 2, 3. <q>And as they (the Apostles) spake unto the People, the Priests, and the Captain of the Temple, and the Sadduces came upon them, being grieved that they taught the People, and Preached thro' Jesus, the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead, and they laid hands on them, and put them in hold, <hi>v. 17.</hi> And that it spread no further (said those Persecutors) among the People; let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no Man in this <hi>Name,</hi> cap. <hi>5.28, 29, 30.</hi> Did not we straitly command you, that you should not Teach in this <hi>Name,</hi> and behold you have fill'd <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and intend to bring this Man's Blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Then <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apostles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and said; we ought to obey God rather than Men. The God of our Fathers, raised up
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:199413:48"/> Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a Tree; him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance to Israel and forgiveness of Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> This then is a good warrant, for all Christian Ministers to maintain their Christian Faith and Confession as God shall enable them, even to the death, and in such cases, we ought to obey God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Man.</p>
                     <p>And the second, being a Negative, suffering for the Profession and Confession of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith is like unto the first, <hi>viz.</hi> 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obey God who hath commanded us to abstain from Idols; and not to fall down and worship graven Images; then to violate our Faith, by a Sinful Compliance. And in this case also are we justified by the Warrant and Command of God, Recorded in the Holy Scriptures, as well as by the constant and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Practice of the Primitive Christians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ten Persecutions, as well as under pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal unscriptural Impositions.</p>
                     <p>But whether the Quakers Sufferings, come under either of these Heads; ought to be duly considered; and that by themselves, as well as others: If they say yea; I then demand an Instance for this Forty six Years, the time of their Date; to shew me a Warrant, under the Hand and Seal of any one Justice of Peace, who committed any one, or more of them, for Preaching through <hi>Jesus</hi> the Resurrection of the Dead. I will not deny, but some of them have been committed for Preaching their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:199413:49"/> Light, in opposition to Jesus, denying the Resurrection of the Dead: But this is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, this is only Prosecution against Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, in defence of the Christian Faith; which yet ought to be done, with great care and tenderness, and by Laws suitable to the Nature of the Offence; having always a regard to the sincerity of the Offenders, who have adhered to wrong Notions, and thereby became Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to mistaken Principles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But if the Quakers shall object, that there have been Laws made by our Christian Kings and Parliaments; which they cannot for Conscience sake obey actively, and to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for their Non-submission. This is Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I answer not so; for then the Quakers themselves, we shall find Persecutors, which they will be loath to acknowledg. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, In <hi>Pensilvania,</hi> there has happen'd a Religious Difference amongst the Quakers: The <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, having the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the Honourable <hi>William Penn,</hi> (as his Title there is; how much soever, they are against Titles of Honour in <hi>England</hi>) Well, So it fell out, that these Governing Quakers, made certain Laws against the Dissenting Quakers: The Dissenting Quakers, they do complain of hard usage; they Print and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse this Complaint. The <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers, they take this as an Affront to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They Issue out their Warrant, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a Printer and a Publisher of this their Complaint: A Copy of which Warrant,

                     <p>Now Reader, observe the Crime, <hi>viz.</hi> For Printing <hi>An Appeal from</hi> 28 <hi>Judges, [viz.</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, who at their Meeting, had not dealt fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by those two Prisoners their Friends, at least they thought so] <hi>to the Spirit of Truth;</hi> and compare the Severity, especially at their Tryal; and see whether these governing Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:199413:50"/> have not exceeded all the Justices of the Peace in <hi>England:</hi> For how do the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in <hi>England</hi> print, publish, and disperse Papers and printed Books, and send them not only throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea, which not only condemn the Ministry and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but throw contempt on the Magistrates, and censure their very Acts of Parliament as Antichristian, to the great scandal of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Government, both in Church and State, and yet they are let alone to do what they please: And notwithstanding all this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, what complaints we have from their yearly Meetings of persecution, to the dishonour of the Christian Magistracy; and in p. 13. of the said Tryals, I find that one <hi>Peter Boss</hi> was Indicted for calling <hi>Sam. Jennings</hi> a Quaker Justice, a <hi>Magisterial Officer,</hi> which as <hi>G. Keith</hi> expounded it, signifies only <hi>Master like,</hi> and yet both Quakers; whilest <hi>W.

                        <q>but above all, Dissenters had little reason to have expected that <hi>Boarish</hi> Fierceness from the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> when they consider his eager prosecution of the King's Party under <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Government, as thinking he could never give too great a Testimony of his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to that new Instrument, which makes the old saying true, that one Runagado is worse than 3 <hi>Turks,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

                     <p>I say considering the station of the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> to be thus abused, and to put up such a base dishonourable and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Affront: It did shew more patience and forbearance, than the Quakers Justices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves can bear, now in place of Authority, as well as shew the Temper of a pragmatical Quaker, <hi>W. Penn</hi> who then and there call'd the Indictments detestable Juggles, Romance Indictments; and why forsooth? because the form of the Indictment contained more than the Witnesses could prove: Yet now the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are led by their Light to go to Law; they can frame as detestable Juggles in their Indictments, as any People whatsoever; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness their Indictment against my self, for printing unlicensed, baring Date the 9th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1693. <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Come <hi>G. W.</hi> I have taken a List of your Sufferings, but before I come to examine whether your Sufferings be persecution, and thereby merit your Title of being <hi>the Church of the First Born;</hi> I shall let the World see that you over value your Sufferings, to a degree of Blasphemy; and that shall be my Text or Subject matter to compare your Sufferings, see <hi>E. Burrow's Works</hi> p. 275. <q>It plainly appeareth, that the Sufferings of the People of God (called Quakers) in this Age, is <hi>greater Suffering</hi> and <hi>more Ʋnjust,</hi> than in the days of Christ, or his Apostles, or in <hi>any</hi> time since. What was done to Christ or his Apostles, was <hi>chiefly</hi> done by a Law; and in <hi>great</hi> part by the <hi>due</hi> execution of a Law; and hereby it appears the Suffering to be more unjust; because what the Persecutors of old time did to the People of God, they did by a Law, and by the <hi>due</hi> Execution of a Law: But now many are caused to suffer
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:199413:52"/> deeply whom the Transgression of no Law, good or bad can be charged against; and others suffer without the due execution of a Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come <hi>G. W.</hi> do you not blush, are you not ashamed to see your Sufferings valued above the Sufferings of Christ, his Apostles, and all his Martyrs since? What horrid Blasphemy is this Quaker Church guilty of? Come seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>George</hi> I will ask you some Questions, and expect your answer, Yea or Nay. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sufferings of the Quakers be <hi>greater</hi> than the Sufferings of Christ, his Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confessors. 2. Are the Sufferings of the Quakers more unjust, than the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, his Apostles and Martyrs. 3. Was the Sufferings, Murder and Cruelty, inflicted upon Christ his Apostles and Martyrs, chiefly done by a Law. 4. By what Law did the <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens execute their Cruelty upon Christ, his Apostles and Prophets. 5. Was the said Laws of the <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens <hi>duly</hi> executed upon Christ, his Apostles and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, as your Doctors Teach; Answer me plainly to all the 5 Questions. Again, I ask you <hi>G. W.</hi> Whether on second Thoughts you will say yea, and so justifie <hi>Burrows?</hi> Or nay, and so condemn the Quakers Doctrine which teach such horrible Blasphemy, and that by your approbation. Besides <hi>George,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Suffered for Preaching, thro' Jesus, the Resurrection of the dead, and Remission of Sins in his Name: But the Quakers suffer for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:199413:52"/> the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> for Preaching from their Light within against what Jesus Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: <hi>Go Baptize,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> &amp;c. Pray after this manner.— <hi>Forgive us our sins, as we forgive them that trespass against us:</hi> And this alters the case very much: The Apostles and Martyrs Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, who Preached and Taught in the Name of Jesus, who wrought Miracles in the Name of Jesus, this was persecution. But the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Suffer, who Teach in their own Name, and thereby make void the Commands of Christ Jesus, under pretence of their Light within, and work Miracles (as they call them) in their own Name: This indeed may be Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but not Persecution, and so no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Quakers being <hi>the Church of the First Born.</hi> And now I shall proceed to the particular cases of the Quakers Sufferings, being 14 in number as abovetold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>We suffer because we cannot pay Tythes to the covetous Priests and Antichristian Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> why then do you not pay your Tythes, and live in subjection to the Laws of the Land according to the Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? who said, <hi>be subject to every ordinance of Man for the Lords sake.</hi> But this is not all, you the Leaders of the Quakers do not only disobey the Law of the Land your selves, but you hold your yearly Meetings in <hi>London,</hi> a week or Ten days together; and there you make Laws, Orders and Decrees, against the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:199413:53"/> known Laws made at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and thereby absolve the King's Subjects of their obedience, so far as they adhere to you as the higher Powers: And for this your presumption I impeached your yearly Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting 1693. in these words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Quakers yearly Meeting, or Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impeached, on the behalf of the Canons of <hi>England, viz.</hi> That <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> and his Brethren, at a Convocation begun at <hi>London</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>May, 1693.</hi> (ending the <hi>8th.</hi> day of the same Month) did contrive, make and promulgate several Constitutions and Canons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical; containing in them divers Matters and Things, contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the Realm; against the King's Prerogative, against the Rights of Parliaments, against the Property of the Subject; and Matters tending to Sedition, and of dangerous consequence.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was the Impeachment, and there was great reason for it; one Instance I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, <hi>viz.</hi> Whereas, there was an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, made since His Present Majesties coming to the Crown, for Exempting His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Protestant Subjects, Dissenting from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the Penalty's of certain Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which Act, there is one Clause, which the Quakers did not like; but soon after, at their High Court, at <hi>Devonshire-house,</hi> Repealed the same, what in them lay, and Absolved the King's Subjects from their Obedience; to the same, as anon will appear: But first, the said Clause, <hi>viz. Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:199413:53"/> that nothing herein contained, shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, to exempt any of the Persons aforesaid, from paying of Tythes, or other Parochial Duty s, or any other Duty's, to the Church or Minister; nor from any Prosecution, in any Ecclesiastical Court, or elsewhere for the same,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I say this Clause, in the Act of Parliament, did not suit with the Quakers Light; and they were moved to Repeal it, and what in them lay to make it void; both by their Printed Laws, directed to all their Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and elsewhere; concerning Tythes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of Churches; as also by their Practice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Quakers Yearly Epistle,</hi> &amp;c. p. 1. <q>And therefore, that all due care be taken, against the <hi>Grand</hi> Oppression, and Antichristian Yoke of <hi>Tythes,</hi> that our Christian Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny born, and greatly suffered for, be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maintained against them, in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; and against Steeple-houses-Rates and Lays; as also against the Burden and Imposition of Oaths.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>—That Friends, at all there Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, be reminded to call for the Records of the Sufferings of Friends; to see that they be duly gathered, truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and kept, and accordingly sent up [to <hi>London</hi>] as hath been often advised; both of what Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are pretended to be due, and for how long a time, and the time when taken, and by, and for whom, and what Goods are taken, and the value thereof; as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:199413:54"/> well of those not exceeding, as them exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Summ or Quantities [of Tythes] de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded (it being a Suffering in both, for Truth's sake) they being in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars found defective and imperfect in divers Country's; which is an Obstruction to the General Record of Friends Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> my old Antagonist, you see my Impeachment, and you may see the reason of it. First, The Parliament have provided in their Act; that nothing therein shall be construed, to exempt the Quakers from payment of their Tythes, Church Dues, and Repairing the Churches: This was done, by King, Lords and Commons, Assembled in Parliament, holden at <hi>Westminster:</hi> But the Quakers at their Convocation, not Legally called, nor by Law permitted; yet they being set at <hi>Devonshire-house,</hi> they enact; That all due care be taken against that <hi>Grand Oppression,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> Yoak, the payment of <hi>Tythes,</hi> against the paying to <hi>Church Wardens Rates,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And when any do Suffer, though no more than their Neighbours; yet a Record thereof must be taken, and brought up to <hi>London,</hi> in order to Print it; and thereby to expose the Magistrates and Legislators, as a Tribe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Persecutors, when there Holy Chronicle came forth, mentioned, in <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> &amp;c. p. 58. and there <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> p. 410. Saying, our Faithful Chronicles, of the Bloody Tragedies of that Professing Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will tell future Ages other things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:199413:54"/> viz. What bitter times of sore Persecution, there was, during the Reign of His Present Majesty, K.<hi>W.</hi> III. which being duly considered, renders them ungratful, with a witness: Forgetting that in there Suffering, for non-payment of Tythes; they do not suffer for keeping the Commands of God, the Precepts of Christ, or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; but only for keeping the Command of <hi>George Fox,</hi> the first Founder of Quakerism.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>We suffer, because we cannot pay the Clarks, that turn up the Hour-glass.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well, what have you suffered, for not paying the Clark his Wages: I have examined your Book, stiled, <hi>The Record of Sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. Where in p. 24. under this Title; <hi>Clarks Wages, and repairing of Steeple houses.</hi> I have read near two Pages, and find nothing suffered, for non-payment of Clarks Wages; but at the end, it concludes thus: <hi>All these Summs, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Repairing of Steeple-houses.</hi> Then I was at a loss, where to find Sufferings on that account; worth presenting the King and Parliament; at least, with much searching in p. 10. 11. I find that <hi>William Tipla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Robert Tiplady,</hi> and <hi>Robert Storehouse,</hi> for Clarks Wages had taken from them, as many Goods, as themselves prised them worth 17 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and more I could not find; Oh! wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that People should so magnifie their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as to think 17 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> worth troubling the King and Parliament: And yet if they think thereby, to merit the Title of being <hi>The Church of the First born;</hi> who can blame them:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:199413:55"/> But I take this Vain Boasting of Suffering, for a great sign of the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>We suffer, because we do not go to the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-house.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> Suffer; but what did you suffer? And what were you enjoyned to come for? Was it to Worship a false God; or the true God, in a false way; for otherwise, every Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, is not Persecution?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>We suffer, because we set open our Shops on Fast-days.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> The more shame for you? Who will hazard your Liberty and Peace, for the observing <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Commandments.</p>
                     <p>But since 'tis no Command of God, that you observe in the keeping your Shop open on Fast-days; but <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Command, 'tis not Persecution: However, many begin to grow wiser now; and shut up there Shops, in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Government: And they begin to trample under foot, the Commands of that Imposter <hi>Fox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>We suffer, because we say thee and thou to a single Person.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> If you can shew any Warrant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hand and Seal of any Justice of Peace, that you suffered purely for that; either Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, Banishment, or spoiling of Goods. I will say, the Justice did not well; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it Persecution: But if you have been laughed at, for your singularity therein; you ought to be content, and never tell the King and Parliament of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>We suffer, because we do not put off our Hats to our Superiors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:199413:55"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> So did <hi>Ignatius Loyola;</hi> (as <hi>Maffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus</hi> and <hi>Orlandinus</hi> testifie) by which, saith a Learned Author (in his Book, <hi>A Discourse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Idolatry practised in the Church of Rome.</hi>) p. 273. <q>We understand, who was the first Founder of that Fanatick Sect amongst us, [the Quakers] Upon this, the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der severely rebuked the Souldiers, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Mad-man before him; who being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at enraged, whipt him soundly, and let him go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and p. 282. Yet any one, who compares them (<hi>i. e.</hi> Quakers) would imagin (saith my Author) the Life of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> had been their great Exampler: I know not whether any of that Innocent and Religious Order of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> had any hand of forming this New Society among us; (as hath been frequently suggested) but if one may guess the Father by the Child's Likeness; <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the Founder of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> was at least the Grandfather of the Quakers.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> you see <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> was soundly whipt; and doubtless, he reckoned it a Suffering; for the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> like the Quakers, love to magnifie there Sufferings: And I do think, some of you may have met with alike Suffering, for the like cause: And you may Record it too, if you please; but still 'tis no Persecution, and cannot merit your Title to the Church of the First Born: yet if you please, it may help you into the Society of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and you may plead Antiquity, to strengthen the Commandment of <hi>George
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:199413:56"/> Fox.</hi> Well, but if you did suffer, as you tell the King and Parliament; I think you had but your just Desert; you pretend, you cannot put off your Hat for Conscience sake to your Superiors? Why then do you compel your Inferiors to stand bare headed before you in your Houses and Shops; this is such a piece of Hypocrisie, that <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> your Grandsire, could not well exceed: Yet this is your practice, I know it, and can prove what I say, from many Instances. And indeed, it was the first piece of Hypocrisie that I found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, when I was a Quaker: And the very first thing, that gave me Offence; and I as early shew'd my dislike thereof; and Wrote a Letter to <hi>Samuel Cater,</hi> to the Yearly Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that it might be remedied; which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, gave great offence; and I was sent for, by <hi>G. Barnadiston;</hi> and I did before him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, maintain it to be a great piece of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie; and said, we might as well put off our Hats to our Superiors, as require it of our Inferiors: And from that time, I was by some few of that Ambitious sort of Teachers; not looked upon to be a right ground fast Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. Thus it pleased God; to bring Good to me, out of your Evil; and that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how early I withstood some Errors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Quakers: I may recite the said Letter, to <hi>Samuel Cater.</hi>

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:199413:57"/> who have Preached a Thousand times against it, and to save thy Bacon, can now do it; and tho' I have printed it and re-printed it; yet thou hast not the confidence to deny it; but if you should, your own Attorney and Mr. <hi>Damell</hi>'s Attorney; whose names I have, both will witness it; nay the whole Court present, took such notice of it, that thou must have a Face of brass to deny it. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> having a Bill exhibited against him, by <hi>Tho. Damell</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, in the Lord Mayor's Court in <hi>London, April</hi> the 9th. 1695. The said Oath follows in these words.</p>
                     <p>☞ <q>You <hi>[G.W.]</hi> do Swear, that so much of this your Answer as you set forth, to be of your own knowledge, to be certain and true;</q> and so much thereof as you set forth to be by Relation of others, you do believe to be true, <hi>so help you God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Oath, in open Court, was read to <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> the Book put to his Mouth; he submitted to it without gainsaying, and it was accepted by the Court for an Oath, and it stands upon Record, as hundreds more so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken do, in that and other Courts. What cause then have the Quakers thus to complain, and pretend Conscience where they make none? I do not charge this as an evil in it self, any more than to take the solemn Attestation prescribed them by the Parliament; for they both call God to witness to the truth of what they say: But the Deceit and Hypocrisy lies in preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Conscience, and to make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:199413:58"/> they cannot Swear, when 'tis manifest the same Men, nay, the most noted, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> for one can Swear in a corner privately. So that this kind of Suffering being void of sincerity, does not amount to a proof that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are the Church of the First Born.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>We suffer, because we meet together to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> This I do deny, on behalf of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates; I never knew such a Law made in <hi>England</hi> to prevent any from Meeting to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, and shall, until the Quakers can shew me such a Law which I never heard of nor saw: Indeed I do know that in the 22 years of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. there was an Act of Parliament entituled <hi>an Act to prevent and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Seditious Conventicles,</hi> in which it was said, <hi>be it Enacted by,</hi> &amp;c. That if any Person of the Age of 16 years and upwards, being a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Realm, at any time after the 10th. day of <hi>May</hi> next, shall be present at any As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under colour or pretence of any exercise of Religion, in other manner then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. at which there shall be five Persons or more Assembled together, over and besides those of the same Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I grant, that if any did transgress this Law, they did incurr certain penalties: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the Government was not charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the scandalous Crime of Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Forasmuch as this Law did not hinder Men
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:199413:58"/> from worshiping the true God in the way he has prescribed, who said, Wherever 2 or 3 are gathered together in my Name, I am in the midst; nor doth it compel Men to do Sacrifice to Idols or graven Images, the works of Mens Hands.</p>
                     <p>And 2dly. In regard it is a written Law, and in our Mother Tongue that all may read it, and see both the danger, and how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; and pay their obedience to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Ministers of it, who bear not the Sword in vain.</p>
                     <p>Again 3dly. This Law allowed a moderate Tolleration, for four Persons might meet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those of the Family, which probably might be ten or fifteen more, which had been a tollerable Meeting, and such as the Martyrs would have been glad of. And I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that had the Quakers regarded the Law, and reverenced the Magistratical Power, and met together modestly, with a purpose only to pray to God, expound a Chapter, and exhort each other to a pious Life; if it had so happen'd, that now and then there had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be ten or twenty more than the Law in strictness allowed; That the Magistrates would, for peace sake, have born it: [And altho' I, when a Quaker, felt the Rod of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for my Stubborness; for in that case, both for blind Zeal and Suffering for the same, I was not behind my equals:] And my Reason is, that since I came to be perswaded I ought to submit to Magistracy, as God's Ordinance,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:199413:59"/> I have had no one thing imposed upon me that was a scruple to my Conscience to perform. But when the Magistrates saw, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, above all People, took no notice of the Law, nor the Power of the Magistrates; but in Scorn and Contempt, trampled under foot all Authority, in Kings, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; in Judges, Justices, and all Inferior Officers, according to their Principles, in <hi>George Foxes</hi> Book, <hi>News coming up,</hi> &amp;c. p. 18. 19. <q>Dreadful is the Lord, who is coming to Execute true Judgment, upon all you Judges; and to change all your Laws, the Kings, all your Rulers must down, and all your Underling Officers, which have been as the Arms of this great Tree; all your Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es must be cut down; so you must be cut down with the same Power that cut down the King, whose Family, was a Nursery for Papists, and for Bishops, which held up Rails, Alters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Woe! woe! is coming upon you all. The same Teachers are standing, that was in the time of the King, and in the time of the Bishops; and such as take Tythes; the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Lord cried against them then, and the Lord hath raised up his Prophets to cry against them, now as then; and against you Judges and Justices, which hath held them up, and maintain'd them with your Law, you must both be tormented together, Beast, and false Prophets: The Lord God will pour out his Plagues upon you; the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:199413:59"/> Lord of Hosts hath spoken it: And except you Repent, you shall all likewise perish and be consumed, as the King was, p. 20. Sing all ye Saints and Rejoyce; clap your Hands and be glad; for the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> will Reign, and the Government shall be taken from you, pretended Rulers, Judges and Justices, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Constables: All this <hi>Tree</hi> must be <hi>Cut down;</hi> and Jesus Christ [in us] will Rule alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I say, when the Magistrates saw their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Government, and understood that their chief Work in their Meetings, as well as Writings, was to lower their Power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Ministers, and Preach against all Instituted Religion; comparing the Magistrates, to <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Darius</hi> &amp;c. And the Clergy, to Witches, Devils, Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Thieves, Robbers, greedy Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Bible, a Dead Letter; Death, Dust, Beastly Ware, Serpents Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Sacraments of Baptisme, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, were no Ordinances of God; but Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them; Idolatry, and no part of the Worship of God, and the like Blasphemies; and also remembring whence they first sprung to wit, out of the Dregs of the People: As Ranters, Levellers, and other Latitudinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And from thence, knowing their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be Antimonarchical; as well as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magistratical: This and the like; (too much to mention here) put the Magistrates upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:199413:60"/> their Power, not in Persecution; but in Prosecuting Wilful and Obstinate Offenders, in defence of the Church and State; at the Foundation of which, the Quakers Principles and Practices seem to strike: But as they served the Act, made for the Payment of Tythes, Church Dues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mentioned in the Answer to the first of these 14 Particulars; they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this; for they from their Yearly Meeting, gave forth their Law, which did virtually (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the Quakers, though not verbally) repeal this Act also; and Absolv'd the King's Subject from their Active Obedience: And when this would not do; their Teachers Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled from East to West, from North to South, sending out their Mandates, to have the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come far and near; that so they might have great and large Meetings, to vend their Pestilential Doctrine, above-told. And that I may not be thought to Impose upon my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; I will give for each of these their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, single Instances.</p>
                     <p>The first shall be that Edict from their year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting, which is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>From all which 'tis observable, that first by their yearly Edicts they set aside null, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:199413:61"/> make void Acts of Parliament, when not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their design, which appears to lay Wast the Christian Religion, as also that their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in their Travels too and fro, send out their Mandates or Summons to gather the people together round the County; yea, saith <hi>R. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diland</hi> Friends <hi>a far off,</hi> no matter what the Law says: For as <hi>G. Fox</hi> said in <hi>Ireland</hi> when the Inn-keeper told him the Council had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forth Warrants to apprehend him; <hi>What do you tell me</hi> (said Fox) <hi>of their Warrants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me? If there were a Cart load of them I do not heed them. Fox</hi>'s Journal p. 278.</p>
                     <p>In like manner their Teachers, writing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Copy, heed not a Cart load of Laws, but in contempt of them, write frequently to have them meet in great Numbers to come from far and near to confront the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yea, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s intimation was like himself, the people must meet, but with whom they must not know, whether a Jesuit or a Monk; the hour is set, they must not fail; and when the Meeting is over, let the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Informers, and the poor deluded Quakers shift together. It would require a Volumn to set forth the covetous Practices, and cunning Politicks, of these Ring-leaders.</p>
                     <p>But as I have given 2 or 3 Instances of the Quakers joynt Testimony against their peoples obedience to the Laws of the Land; and also of their Teachers, in their Travels too and fro to seduce the people, not only from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, but from their Allegiance to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:199413:62"/> their Governors, as appears from plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact. So it will not be amiss to give one Instance of their Teachers deceitful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, whereby they blind the World, delude their Hearers, and mis-represent the Acts and Deeds of the Christian Magistrates; First to this, but more especially to the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by their faithful Chronicle so often mentioned: And that the World may know they have a design to bring out a Volumn of their Sufferings in the nature of the Book of Martyrs. I will give some few manifest To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of it, or there can be none given; and also a Sample of their pretended Sufferings of which they so much Glory, as that it is a Sign they are the Church of the First-born, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> &amp;c. p. 41. <q>Our faithful Chronicles of the bloody Tragedies of that professing Generation, will tell Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages other things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> I take this to be a fair Item of what they intend: But above all I commend their Politicks, in staying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they produce it till the next Age, when none will be alive to detect their Falacies; 'tis too like <hi>George Fox,</hi> who published his counterfeit Miracles 20 years after he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have wrought them, as his Journal manifests. But again,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A Rejoynder,</hi> &amp;c. p. 410. <q>New pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations may give fresh occasion for their History to come abroad to the Nation more compendiously than ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:199413:62"/> we have had, more than 20 years since, and yet no compendious History of their sore Persecutions is yet come forth, though many would be glad to see it: But hold, 'tis not to tell us, but future Ages, I commend them, that's most safe for Hypocrites. I also Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that about the year 1672 or 1673 I was chosen to go up to <hi>London</hi> about our Sufferings, and then I heard several eager to have it come forth, others that had more wit in their Anger sa d nay, but let it alone still.

                     <p>I think, this Third Stroak, has struck the Nail to the head; it need not be Paraphrased upon: It was in 76; and by their Learned <hi>Barklay:</hi> Yet I shall give the World a fresher Instance, even in 1693. when (one would think) the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers had no cause to complain of Persecution; but all is one: They love to talk of their Sufferings, and as well to magnifie them; they are still at work, like Moles under ground. They told us, in the Epistle prefixt to <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>'s Works, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>First of all, our Mouths were opened, and our Spirit filled with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against the Priests and Teachers, and with them, and against them. We first began to War, as the Fountain of all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; the Issue of Prophaneness: And this was the first Work we entered upon; to thresh down the Deceivers, and lay them open; that all People might see their Shame, and come from them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, so they continue; they are no Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. 'Tis the Alpha and Omega of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> uses to call for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tools than I am;</q> and indeed, I think 'tis high time for them to appear; for I own my self too weak for this great Work; to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and lay open the most Formidable Heresie that ever appear'd, since the dayes of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> I grant there are but few see the Quakers, and fewer that take notice of them, and still fewer that understand the danger of their undermining Principles: But if any be desirous to make a search into this matter, I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:199413:63"/> refer them to two Books, viz. <hi>The Snake in the Grass,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Satan Disrob'd,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>George Keith's Labours.</hi> And so I proceed to my 4th. and last Instance on this Head.</p>

                     <p>Reader, in these four Instances you have the Heart of Quakerism, and the Hands and Pens of <hi>W. Penn, R. Barkly, G. Whitehead</hi> and the Heads of the Gang: You see their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign from first to last, and the continuance of it. And now let me give you an Instance of one of their Teachers Deceit and his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Suffering, I mean <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> I do not mean his Suffering the loss of his Kettle, worth (as himself said five Shillings) for a fine of ten-pence for non payment of Tythes, as in their Book, <hi>The Record of Sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. p. 5. But whether the said Kettle was return'd I cannot tell; no I do not mean that, I mean his Suffering Twenty Pounds, for preaching in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> I would say his pretence so to suffer. <hi>The case is this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> of <hi>Little-port</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> being at a Meeting in <hi>Phakenham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk, July</hi> 1670. Was convicted for Preaching, and Fined Twenty Pounds, by Sir <hi>Christopher Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp;</hi> and the Records of conviction was sent to <hi>Thomas March, John Laney,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Hitch</hi> Esquires, Justices of the Peace for the Isle of <hi>Ely;</hi> who, according to Law, Issued out their Warrants for Distress and Sale of <hi>Sam. Cater</hi>'s Goods. Well, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Executed their Warrant, distrained his Goods, Timber, and other Lumber to the value of Twenty Pounds, but left them all in <hi>Sam</hi>'s Possession, at least under his Wall in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:199413:64"/> the Streets side; and some time after a calm happen'd, and the Constable being a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man, did not sell a peny-worth, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd all and every thing so distrain'd to <hi>Sam.</hi> again, and thus ended this Man's most cruel Suffering, for which he made such a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cry, as afterwards you shall here.</p>
                     <p>Well, <hi>Sam.</hi> being distrain'd, he presently came to our Quarterly Meeting, where I was then Recorder, and brings me the state of his case, and by his direction I Recorded as followeth, viz. <hi>See their Quarterly Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Samuel Cater,</hi> for being at a Meeting at <hi>Phakenham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> on the 4th. Day of the 5th. Month called <hi>July, Anno.</hi> 1670. Preaching and Publishing the Gospel of Peace: One <hi>Anne Watts</hi> a Woman Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer told the Officers, who came with a Warrant and had him before one <hi>Christopher Colthorp</hi> a Justice, who Fined him Twenty Pounds, which Warrant and Conviction was sent to the Justices in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>John Laney, Hen. Hitch,</hi> and <hi>Tho. March,</hi> who in pursuance of the said <hi>Norfolk</hi> Justices Conviction, sent their Warrants to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of <hi>Little-port</hi> who distrained as much Houshold stuff and Timber, from the said <hi>Samuel,</hi> as was worth more than Twenty Pounds.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now thus far it was true, that <hi>Sam.</hi> was at that Meeting convicted, the conviction sent into the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and also true, that he was distrained, as I above observ'd, but the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:199413:65"/> Goods distrained were never Sold, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to him again, and consequently <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> no Sufferer. And yet there being but the colour of a Suffering, that he might not loose the glory of it, he presently got it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Quarterly Book, as a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Valour and notable Courage; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing future Ages what the Quaker Teachers were; and that not only this Sir <hi>Christopher Colthorp,</hi> but the Justices, in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> had a hand in this lamentable Tragedy; and that they must stand Recorded Persecutors to future Ages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Reader, does not this look Formidable? Will not people that read this a hundred years hence, when this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chronicle, and Compendious History comes out, look like a noble Suffering, a valiant Act, and deservedly Famous? But alas! alas! it was so far from a Suffering, that it was no Suffering at all, in that he had his Goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; nay yet worse, for he had Ten Pounds sent him from <hi>London</hi> out of the Quakers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, Fund or Treasury, or what you will call it, by <hi>John Peacock</hi> late of St. <hi>Ives</hi> Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as an encouragement, doubtless, for him to clap his Hands and Heart on the poor Hearers, who tho they Suffer really, are not proportionably Rewarded to what the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers meet with; for I find in the same old Records; that <hi>Sam. Fulligg, Clem. Crabb, Tho. Hawkes, James Peachey, John Love, Hen. Waddelow. Rob. Crabb,</hi> for being at a Meeting the 9th. of <hi>June,</hi> 1670. Had as many Horses,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199413:65"/> Cows, Mares, Pewter, and Brass, and other things taken, as was worth much more than <hi>Sam.</hi> had distrained, yet I never heard they had any thing sent them from the Bankers, and Purse-mongers at <hi>London.</hi> But this is not all yet, tho this be bad enough, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a most horrible cheat put upon future Ages: To stand Recorded a Sufferer Twenty Pounds, when he Suffered not a Groat; nay, so far from that, that for his noble Act he had Ten Pounds sent him; so that he got Ten Pounds clear into the pocket. And tho I say this is a horrible cheat, and a Blot it will be on their Chronicle, and a blemish to their Pretences; yet I still say there is worse, at least an Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this Cheat: See a Book stiled, <hi>The Lamentable Cry of Oppression,</hi> &amp;c. Put forth by <hi>Samuel Cater</hi> and <hi>Joseph Harrison,</hi> 9 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this crying Fine of 20 <hi>l.</hi> where in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Reader; they thus Write. <q>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader, should we have set out all the matter and manner of Proceedings; it would have swel'd into too big a Volumn, and may make the <hi>Heathen</hi> to question the Christian Religion, and the Papists laugh, and p. 14. Here being a Meeting, at the House of <hi>Joseph Harrison,</hi> in <hi>Phakenham,</hi> the 2d, of the 5th. Month, 1670. And <hi>Samuel Cater</hi> being there, and declaring the Truth to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple present; <hi>William Watts</hi>'s Wife came, and after some time went to inform the Officers thereof, who came and had Friends before <hi>Christopher Colthorp:</hi> Then <hi>Samuel</hi> appealed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:199413:66"/> to the Justice; the Justice answered, he would Fine <hi>Samuel</hi> 20 <hi>l.</hi> which accordingly he did, and sent the Records of Conviction to the Magistrates at <hi>Ely;</hi> who sent out their Warrants, and took away his Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Thus far <hi>Sam.</hi> printed 1679.</p>
                     <p>Thus Reader you see that 9 Years after this Fine was levied, <hi>Sam.</hi> renews his complaint afresh, as if he had a mind to have Ten Pounds more, but not a word of his Goods being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, not a word of his Ten Pounds sent him from <hi>London.</hi> Well, his <hi>Norfolk</hi> Friends poor hearts, they thought doubtless that he had been a Twenty Pound Sufferer, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof a Ten Pound gainer; Oh mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous! Are these the great Sufferers, who pretend, nay say plainly, that their Sufferings are greater than the Sufferings of Christ and his Apostles or Martyrs, as anon I shall shew? Well, but <hi>Sam.</hi> has not done yet, but in p. 44. <q>And now it is upon me [saith <hi>Samuel</hi>] from the Lord to warn you all that have had any hand in oppressing his Children, and evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating his Servants and Messengers that he has sent amongst you, to exhort you to turn from the evil of your ways, and the violence that is in your Hands and Hearts; but instead of receiving them and their Testimony<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Viz. Sam.</hi> and his Testimony, the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded great Sufferer.</note> you have caused them to suffer<note n="†" place="margin">Behold the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Man.</note> and them that did receive them and their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony; the Lord give
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:199413:66"/> you Repentance before it be too late, and you be cut off, is the desire of him<note n="*" place="margin">Yea, if you can get <hi>10</hi> l. clear by your suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</note> that chuses ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to live in the pleasures of this World.</q>
                        <hi>S. Cater.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> I have not done with you yet; I have still more to say, why your Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings do not merit you the name of the Church of the First Born; though I have shewed enough, to be a great sign of the contrary. I must a little view some other Sufferings in this Book, before I leave this Head; you know your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Burrows</hi> say, p. 273. <q>That the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the People of God (called Quakers) in this Age is a <hi>greater</hi> Suffering, and more unjust, then in the dayes of Christ or of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, or any time since. What was done to Christ and the Apostles was <hi>chiefly</hi> done by a Law, and in great part by the <hi>due</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of a Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Come <hi>G. W.</hi> I will not now animadvert on the Blasphemy of this your Doctrine, nor yet wherein you justifie the <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens in their Murdering the Lord of Life and Glory; and persecuting the holy Apostles and blessed Martyrs to Death, for his Name's sake, tho' for this piece of Blasphemy, as well as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more in it, the Book ought to be Burnt on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> as a Testimony against your Blasphemous Tenets: No my work at this time shall be first to Collect some of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in <hi>Samuel Cater</hi>'s Book, which he says
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:199413:67"/> will make the Heathen Question the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and the Papists laugh and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens blush; it is Intituled, <hi>The Lamentable Cry</hi> of <hi>Oppression,</hi> represented to <hi>all</hi> moderate Men in <hi>Authority.</hi> And when I have Collected a Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of these your Friends Sufferings; then I shall Collect some of the Apostles and Martyrs Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and leave the World to judge who are the greatest, which suffered the most, by or without a Law; and upon whom the Law was most duly Executed.</p>

                     <p>Reader, I have taken in I think the greatest number of the Sufferers, from 1668 to 1675, and it wants of 20 <hi>l.</hi> and yet what a cry, yea a lamentable cry is here; and the Magistrates Actions brought to the <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> to laugh and have them in derision. They tell us in one place, so much Beef at 14 <hi>l.</hi> to the Stone, least some should think they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered less then they did; but suppose these had their Goods again, as <hi>Cater</hi> had; how then is the World impos'd upon. For my part, I suffered more than five times the value above mentioned; and yet I think I never Recorded
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:199413:68"/> any: If you find any of mine in your Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Book, pray race them out; for I am not willing to leave a Hoof in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Now I come to give the World a hint of the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of some of the Apostles and Martyrs, and the manner of their death under the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperors; that thereby all Men may see the difference, and judge between me and the Quakers. I say that the Sufferings of Christ, his Apostles and Martyrs, is greater Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more unjust, than the Sufferings of the Quakers: The Quakers say that the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Quakers are greater than the Sufferings of Christ, his Apostles and Martyrs. Now Read and Judge; if they tell you that I have taken but a few of the Quakers Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I answer, I have taken more for their part, than I have of those who have Suffered for Christ's sake. No, I have not taken the Hundred-Thousand part of the Sufferings of the Apostles and Martyrs; but have (as above) taken a considerable Sample of what the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have Suffered for the cause of <hi>George Fox,</hi> and the larger on both Heads, to prove the Sufferings of the Apostles and Martyrs is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sufferings and more unjust, than the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Quakers: But when I have done all <hi>G.W.</hi> and his poor infatuated Disciples, whom he hath trained up to believe as their Church believe, in his Book <hi>The Apostate Incendiary,</hi> &amp;c. will not believe it, because <hi>Edward Burrow,</hi> their great Prophet, have said the contrary, in his Works p. 273. No, no, The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:199413:68"/> Quakers write by the Eternal Spirit, and that is Infallible; and as such, says <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in his Apology, of greater Authority than the Scriptures: Oh! the sad consequence of the Quaker-Church's Infallibility: Nay ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, if <hi>Edward Burrow</hi> had wrote that a small Tennis-Ball had been bigger than the great City of <hi>London, George Whitehead</hi> would, at least might, have as warrantably vindicated that monstrous lye, as this horrid Blasphemy, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sufferings of the Quakers are greater and more unjust than the Sufferings of Christ and his Apostles and Martyrs: And this is the picture of right Quakerism; and I am resolv'd, God permitting, to hang it out and lift it up, that all People may see it and behold it in all its parts; that so it may be clearly seen, and being seen, may be abhorr'd of all sensible People. And First I shall give a hint of the Apostles Sufferings, <hi>viz. John Baptist,</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, Matthew, Andrew, Mark, Bartholomew,</hi> &amp;c. Some of whom were flee'd alive; some their brains knock'd out; some Crucified, some Burned alive; some put in boyling Oil, some clubb'd to death, and the like Tortures. Come <hi>George,</hi> if the Quakers were not given up to strong Delusion to believe a lye, I think I have said enough already to convince them, that the Suffering of the Apostles were far greater and more unjust than the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Quakers. Next see the History of the Chronicles of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> compiled by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:199413:69"/>
                        <hi>Samuel Morland, Anno</hi> 1658. where you may find, that the Papists cut off a Womans Breast, and part of her privaties, and fryed them and eat them. They also cut off a Man's privy Members and put a lighted Candle to the Wound, stabb'd him divers times on the soles of his Feet, then hang'd him up by the hands, tearing off his Nails with Pinchers; dragg'd him about the Streets until his Eyes and Brains dropt out, and then cast him into a River. See p. 341. 640. Again, a Woman carrying her Child in a Cradle, being pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Papists she left her Child, whom they took and pluckt in four quarters; and afterwards finding the Mother, they Ravish'd her, and cut off her Head, leaving her in the Snow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and much more of this nature in p. 348. Again, in p. 350. a young Woman was fleeing, which was about 18 Years old, and being taken, the Papists thrust a Pike thorow her alive, and roasted her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, p. 352. They cut off a Man's Nose and Ears who was 80 Years of Age, and left him in the Snow, who dyed there. And p. 354. They stript one Man naked, and tore of his Nose with Pinchers, and made holes in his Hands, and dragg'd him with a Cord by the middle, cutting his Flesh saying, wilt not thou go to Mass; and then they cut off his Head and threw him into the River, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And many hundreds of Instances of like nature, which for brevities sake I omit. Come <hi>Geo.</hi> were not these Sufferings greater than the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:199413:69"/> Sufferings of the Quakers; and what Law had they for these unheard of Cruelties and Barbarities; if a Law shew it, and tell us whether it was duly executed upon them.</p>
                     <p>Next, let me remind you of the Horrible Massacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where many Thousands of Men, Women, and Children, were Unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully Murthered by the Papists for the Name of Christ, too large here to Relate.</p>
                     <p>Next, I come to those Cruelty's Inflicted on the Christians by the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperors, for the first three Hundred Years after Christ: In the ten Persecutions, briefly thus.</p>

                     <p>I might enumerate many more, but this (sure) may suffice, to shew that the Quakers Sufferings may not compare with the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Christians.

Condemn your Books that Teach these Errors, and Retract them. Remember <hi>(George)</hi> I told you there is <hi>Magnus Major Maximus,</hi> great, greater, and greatest of all? Now, which Sufferings were greatest, the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:199413:70"/> Christians or the Quakers? Answer this knotty Question Infallably; and then tell me whether your Sufferings merit you to be esteemed the Church of the First Born: Considering many of your Sufferings are mere shams, as in <hi>Caters</hi> Case.</p>

On purpose to render the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Persecutors, in your intended Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Compendious History, which you tell us shall come and shew future Ages other things. I say, you cannot shew us a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or Copy of it: For there is no Law in <hi>England,</hi> to compel Men to follow Games, Sports, and Plays. And I also deny that ever you were compelled under Pain or Penalty to wear costly Apparel, or to powder your Hair; for there is no such Law in being, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently no such Persecution, to make a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:199413:71"/> Man suffer for not following Games, Sports, and Plays, or to wear costly Apparel, and Powder their Hair. But I do remember when I first came amongst you, it was the chief subject [setting aside your clamoring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Clergy] and common Theam, to Preach against Fine Cloath's, Rich Diet, Good Houses, Lofty Horses, Coaches, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Perrywigs, Waiting Men, and Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Maids; the calling Master, Sir, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, Madam, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now I appeal to all that know you well, whether there be any People in <hi>England,</hi> your Station considered, that wear Finer Cloath, Richer Silks, that eat daintier Dishes, that drink better Ale and Richer Wines, that live in better Houses, Ride on Loftier Horses, and better Leathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Conveniencies; vulgarly called Coaches, Calashes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That wear better Perriwigs, and more daintily Powdered; with well set Beavers, and Fashionable Hat Bands; that have better Attendance, both in Waiting Men and Waiting Maids, Footboys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so by your own Doctrine are no Christians, but <hi>Heathens.</hi> And that you may not think I wrong you, ☞ is a Book of yours, well frought with this kind of Doctrine, which I perceive you have forgot; so that you had need say your old Gare over again, and see whence you are fallen and repent; and in order to it, I would advice you to have this Book read in your Assemblies, and let it be sent with your next yearly Epistle,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:199413:71"/> to <hi>Barbadoes, Maryland, East</hi> and <hi>West Jersy, Pensilvania, Burmudoes, Antegua, Holland, Ireland, Scotland, Virginia, New-England, North-Carolina, Rhod Island, Long-Island, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, Jamaica</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and thorow <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> even to the utmost bounds of your Dominion, wherever your Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Hypocricy hath got footing, from the Seat of the Beast and Court of Antichrist, your yearly Meeting. I say let it be read in all your Meetings, as an Antidote against Pride and Excess, and the sin of Epicurisme, which many of your Teachers, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers amongst you are tinctured withal. I hope you will not take it amiss in that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend one of your own Epistles to be read amongst you, which you say was wrote by the Eternal Spirit, through <hi>James Parnell;</hi> which was before all Disputes and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies were. I know if I had recommended the Scriptures, you would have rejected them as Death, Dust, Serpents Meat, Beastly Ware, Husk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> your frequent Epithets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, the Book is Intituled, <hi>The Trumpet of the Lord blown or a Blast against Pride,</hi> &amp;c. Printed, 1655. p. 1. 3. 5. <q>Woe be to you that are called Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen and Gentlewomen; who are called of Men Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Sir, Mistress and Madam; you that have your dainty Dishes, your Wine and Ale, your Fine Attire, your new Fashions, your Silk and Velvet, your Waiting Men and Waiting Maids, your Coaches to Ride in,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:199413:72"/> your High and Lofty Horses to Ride upon, your curious Houses, and so are no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans but <hi>Heathens;</hi> both Priests and People. And now Repent and Tremble before the Lord you Children of the Devil, for you are the Fruitless Trees that cumber the ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>George</hi> have I answered your 13th. Complaint to the King and Parliament, that the Magistrates made you suffer because you would not follow Games, Sports and Plays, and ware powdered Hair, which was a great lye. However I have pointed to you an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of your own writing, and returned it home to your selves who most need it.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>And lastly, because many Women speak abroad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Come <hi>George,</hi> for as I never desire a weaker Antagonist than you, so am I still minded to direct my Speech to you. You say you suffer because your Women speak abroad, and perhaps there's reason enough for it: Therefore 1st. What do they speak? 2dly. Where do they speak? 3dly. What do they suffer for speaking? Possibly they learnt of <hi>George Fox</hi> and your self to call the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures Dust, Death, Beastly-Ware, Serpents Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if so, for this they ought to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, which yet if they do, is no persecution but prosecution of Offenders. Again, possibly they learnt of him, <hi>George Fox,</hi> to go into Churches and be clamarous; if so, for that also they ought to suffer; and therefore if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:199413:72"/> they have left those evil practices because of their Suffering, I think it's well bestowed on them. So that tho' I grant the Quakers have suffered, yet I hope I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be no persecution; neither is their Sufferings a convincing Argument to me that they are the Church of the First-Born.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN my former Books I thought my self obliged to Apologize for my writing against the Errors of the Quakers, because some People then, even the Author of <hi>the Snake in the Grass,</hi> &amp;c. thought I might wrong them, as the Quakers sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, who since are better satisfied therein, their Mask being taken off: But yet some objections still remain, to obviate which, I shall proceed to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. 1.</hi> But say some, <hi>Fra. Bugg</hi> in his Book Entituled, <hi>The Qua. Detected,</hi> &amp;c. gave a tollerable account of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers respecting their beginning; and now to write contrary seems contradictory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I do acknowledge, that in the year <hi>1686.</hi> when I wrot that Book, I had better thoughts of them, respecting their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:199413:76"/> than now I have; neither did I then in <hi>1686.</hi> know them guilty of holding such pernicious Principles and Fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, as now I know they do; having then not seen many of their Books, which since I have both seen and perused. But grant I did not so clearly see them then as now, nor understand their Fundamental Errors so clearly then as now; yet I saw enough to justifie my separation from them, from the charge of Apostacy, as I made fully appear, not only in that Book, but also in my Book, <hi>i. e. New Rome unmask'd,</hi> &amp;c. neither did my acknowledging them and their deportment, and the simplicity and plainness of their Carriage, which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them and their Doctrine [which I since understand was only a decoy to catch simple Souls] to be a reason for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Orthodox, and my self an Apostate from the Christian Faith, since not only I, but Men more Learned, and of better Judgments than I have been mistaken; Witness that famous Man and worthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of Jesus Christ, Archbishop <hi>Cranmer.</hi> See <hi>Fox's</hi> Acts and Mon. p. <hi>1488.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Taught in the beginning a pure Doctrine; but after she
<pb facs="tcp:199413:76"/> fell into the new Doctrine of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, I marvel that any one could allow it if they knew it: But, whatever they bear the people in hand, that which they write in their Books hath neither Truth nor Comfort. Again p. <hi>1325. ibid.</hi> I am [said <hi>Huge Latimer</hi> that worthy Martyr] Ignorant of things which I trust hereafter to know, as I do now know things in which I have been Ignorant heretofore; ever learn, and ever to be learned to profit with learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I thought in time past that the Pope was Christ's Vicar, had been Lord of all the world as Christ is: So that, if he should have deprived the King of his Crown it had been enough, for he could do no wrong: Now I think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. I thought in time past that if I had been a Fryer in a Coul I could not have been Damned, nor afraid of Death; and by reason thereof, I have been minded many times to have been a Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, namely when I was sore sick and diseased: But now I behold my Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Foolishness. It were two long to tell you what blindness I have been in,
<pb facs="tcp:199413:77"/> and how long it were e'er I could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake such Folly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reader, These two Instances (if there were no more) shew forth, that the best of Men are fallible and may err as I did, and be mistaken; as also the Humility of these two learned Prelates and worthy Martyrs are exemplary in their Christian acknowledgment thereof, and forsaking such a corrupted Church, infected with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superstition, which cleared them from the charge of Apostacy; and the same cause leads to the same thing: And if I once had a good opinion of the Quakers, you see these famous Men had as good, if not a better opinion of the Papists, who yet left them and forsook them as I did the Quakers; and for which I bless God, who put it into my heart to forsake such a manifest Heresie. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. 2.</hi> But say the Quakers in their Book <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> &amp;c. p. <hi>78. But herein you shew your malice; for, had</hi> G. F. <hi>been a cursing Man, like</hi> Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Implying it somewhat pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable then to write against the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:199413:77"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> See their Book <hi>Truth's Defence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>G. Fox's</hi> words to Mr. <hi>Camelford</hi> a Minister, thus, <q>O thou filthy Beast, no Prayers can we send to thee, but for thy Destruction, thou Man of Sin and Enemy of Christ. — O thou impudent and brazen fac'd; — thou Hypocrite and Pharisee thou art damn'd openly. — Thou art in the Sorcery, in the Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and in the Adultery, and in the corrupt Seed, whose Blessings are Cursed. —O thou slanderous Beast;— thou na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Brute beast: — and here I charge thee to be a Witch, and to bewitch the People. — Thou deaf Adder and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, —thou child of the Devil, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Enemy of all Righteousness.—O thou falsehearted dissembling Hypocrite; the Plagues of God are due to thee, and that is thy portion, — thou blind Sot, — thou dark Sot; — thy Torment is but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and so fare thee well: Thus far <hi>Fox.</hi>
                     </q> Again, hear another of the same Fraternity, viz. <hi>Ed. Burrow</hi> in his Works p. <hi>29, 30, 31.</hi> In Answer to certain Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries sent to the Quakers by one Mr. <hi>Bennet, Burrow's</hi> Answer runs in this Channel, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>Thou art manifest what thou art, where
<pb facs="tcp:199413:78"/> thou art, and what Spirit thou art off: a Reprobate, a child of Darkness; the Light condemns thee and all thy Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [of Priests] Eternally we witness thee and all thy Generation to be in the Witchcraft and Sorcery,—for thou art Darkness it self:—Here thou, full of all subtilty, hast made manifest thy Poyson and Enmity: —Here thou Jesuit, —and thou Reprobate, see whether thou be'st not a blind ignorant Sot; —there thou accursed art made manifest: —Here thou beast, to whom the Plagues of God are due, and upon whom his wrath must be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished: Here thou dark blind Hypocrite, —thou dead Beast; —here thou polluted Beast; —here stop thy mouth thou Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; O thou dark Beast and Conjurer, who art Querying with thy Conjuring words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reader, behold and be amazed! that this people should blame any body for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against them, when never did any write like themselves; nor was <hi>Muggleton</hi> a greater Curser and Damner than <hi>Fox.</hi> The next I shall mention is their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Fisher,</hi> who writing against <hi>John Owen, Richard Baxter, Thomas Danson,</hi> and

                     <hi>John Tombs,</hi> In his Book Stiled, <q>
                        <hi>The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks Alarm,</hi> &amp;c. calls and compares them to Lizards, Moles, Tinkers, Red-coats, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, Green-headed Trumpeters, Rare and Base, Wheelbarrows, Gimcracks, Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools, and Whirlygigs, a Moon-calf, their Bell has no Mettle but the sound of a Kettle, capers about, quivers up and down like a blind Night-bat, Ragged, Torn, Thredbare, Tatterdemallions, malicious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Vipers grinning Dogs, Jack-puddings, dunceable Darkness, gropable Blindness; —Then so many leaps of a Louse, bo to a Goose, Hedge-hogs, Fiery fighters; <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Tombs</hi> as Twins that tumbled out of one Belly, the womb of that Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish Bawd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All which idle Drollery and ridiculous Nonsence is vindicated by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> in his Epistle prefixed to this <hi>Sam. Fisher</hi>'s Works, saying, <q>It was so ordered by God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that his [<hi>Fisher</hi>'s] part fell to be most Controversial, in which to carry a clear Mind, and an even Hand, is very difficult: However allowing him, in some passages, the freedom of the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> against the Prophets of <hi>Baal [1 Kings 18, 27.]</hi> sometimes exposing absurd things
<pb facs="tcp:199413:79"/> by vulgar Terms and Proverbs to Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in the view of his ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he hath discharged himself as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious, fair, and learned Apologist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if the Quakers will have allowance from the Prophets to vent this sort of wild Gibberish, I hope I may take a little li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to expose their absurd Principles to the just abhorrence and derision of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. 3.</hi> But some may say, was there no way to accommodate this Controversy without this publick method; surely a more Amicable and Friendly way had been more sutable to a religious Difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It would be too tedious to recite the many and frequent offers that I have given them from time to time to meet me, and that according to the very words of their own propositions, but they would not; I have sent them Summons after Summons, until at last I Summoned <hi>12</hi> of their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to give me a meeting, but they would not; a Copy thereof is as followeth.</p>

                  <p>But this being sent to divers of them near <hi>6</hi> Months since, and they will neither hear nor answer any proposition how equal soever it be; tho' I have often wrote to them and spoke to them. Therefore I now proceed to lay their pernicious, as well as presumptious, Errors further open; and in
<pb facs="tcp:199413:80"/> so doing I shall not spare them, nay, nor pity them, being wholly clear of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. 4.</hi> But if this had been sooner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they got to this heighth, and to this order and settlement, as to have their Classes, their Provincial Synods, their Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Synods and Councels, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Government, it might happily have stopt their further growth, which now seems impossible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I grant their Heresie is of long continuance, yet the <hi>Arrians</hi> much longer; which continued, as I have read, more than <hi>300</hi> Years; who thro' their subtilty got so much into the favour of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to get the Pulpit, and the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Orthodox; yet they are dispersed and withered away, and these have not yet been half a century, and their Errors more notorious: And 'tis my belief they will not remain the other half before they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded. Why then should any be discourag'd in such a work? The Pope and his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions have not gone on without many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies against them. 'Tis said that our famous <hi>Wickliff,</hi> an <hi>Oxford</hi> Scholar, has wrote more than <hi>200</hi> Volumns against his Errors and Innovations: And I hope we
<pb facs="tcp:199413:80"/> are not without some such now in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Universities; who, as they become sensible of this Quicksilver Tribe, I mean <hi>New Rome;</hi> and know where to fix upon them, and their invisible Tenets, which at present they mask under disguise, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in words, being examin'd, what in their Books, they deny: For indeed, their Books are of two sorts, carrying two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faces. The one to the World, to decoy people, the other to their Friends to be read in their Meetings, insomuch as 'tis hard to know a Quaker, who, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> said in his third Book against Hereticks, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>Whil'st Hereticks speak like the Faithful, they not only mean otherwise than what they say, but clean contrary; and by their Tenets full of Blasphemy, they destroy the Souls of those, who with their fair words suck in the poyson of their foul Opinions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> And no marvel (saith St. <hi>Paul) for Satan himself is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into an Angel of light: therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be also transformed as the ministers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, whose end shall be according to their works, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>13.14.</hi> And for our pattern we have the famous <hi>Wickliff,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:199413:81"/> pav'd the way for great <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> who was wonderfully carryed on, even as upon Angels Wings; which made the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists rave and roar, fret and fume; calling him Apostate, Self-condemn'd Apostate; insomuch that all Mens minds stood (as it were) upon their tiptoes to see the issue of Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s rage; and brave <hi>Luther</hi>'s courage, who went on undauntedly writing many Books, until he finished both his Days and Testimony, of whom <hi>Beza</hi> said,
<q>

                           <hi>Rome</hi> tam'd the World, the Pope tam'd <hi>Rome</hi> so great;</l>

                  <head>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE Rice, Growth, and Progress OF Quakerism;</head>
                  <head type="sub">
                     <hi>With a modest Correction of the General History of the Quakers, writ in</hi> Holland <hi>by the Learned</hi> Croese, <hi>Anno</hi> 1696.</head>
                  <div type="prologue">
                     <head>The PROLOGUE.</head>
                     <p>WHen I first heard of the said History, I thought it might have spared me this Labour; hoping it would have given an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Account; not only of the coming in of that Sect, of the names of the Persons, of the places of their abodes, of their Handicraft professions, of their tumultuous behaviours, of their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:199413:82"/> out their Defamations, and scurrilous Languages to Magistrates and Ministers, and of their frequent disturbing the Churches, and contemning the Ordinances of Christ and all Instituted Religion: <hi>But also</hi> the ways and methods by which Quakerism have grown and increased, and prevailed to this heigth it is now arrived at: But when I came to view it, and seriously to consider the Contents of it, as I find it in many things very well done, with respect to the former particulars, and thereby will spare me some pains and cost; so with respect to the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> to set forth their pernicious Doctrines, their horrible Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, their dissembling Cheats and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Frauds; [by which they have not only deceived Thousands, but almost perswaded many well meaning and worthy Gentlemen to have a better esteem of them, and their Tenets, than they deserve] I found it very deficient, <hi>viz.</hi> In shewing the methods by which they have risen, and their Hypocrisie and wretched ways by which they have spread their blasphemous Errors, and pernicious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and how they have unchurched all but themselves; and thereupon it seemed to me, that the said History rather tends to strengthen them in their Errors, then to help them out of them; for it bends too much to the left hand, and reflects on our English Magistrates as Persecutors, and on our Church as not well disciplined; which I charitably presume, was occasioned by that Learned Authors giving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199413:82"/> too much credit to the Books and Manuscripts, and his conversation with some of them, for saith he, p. 5. <q>Since therefore I have had the fortune of a long time to be familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and much conversant with these men call'd Quakers, and that in many places, and besides, many of their Writings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, of which some are in print, some not, having fallen into my hands I thought it would be an acceptable Enterprise to write upon this Subject, leaving it for every Man to judge as he thinks fit, of their Actions, Tenets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And since I find the said History as above observ'd, to be deficient in the main Part, at least, in many main Points, I shall write some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Correction, which I hope neither he, nor any other indifferent Person will take amiss, since I pretend to have as much experience and knowledge of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers as he can pretend too, having the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be many Years conversant with them and their Teachers, as also the good fortune to know their Methods, to have of their Writings and Manuscripts by me, some in print, some not, whereby I have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to detect them, and to confute their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and so I shall leave it to every Man (as he saith) to judge as he pleaseth of their Actions, Tenets, Customs, way of Church-Government, and principles of Religion, and Doctrine, which I shall produce from Book and Page of their most Authentick Authors.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:199413:83"/>
                     <p>First then, that it may appear I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to know the Quakers as well as this Learned Author, and thereupon as warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a Motive to write on this Subject: In the Year 1657. I went first amongst the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; and in 1659. became one of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and continued amongst them about 25 years; and since that time I have been a narrow observer of them, and much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many of them: I have near 300 of their Books by me, besides Manuscripts and old Records; and besides all this, I was Clark to their Monthly and Quarterly Meetings for the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> and County of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> at <hi>Haddenham, Sutton</hi> and <hi>Chatterise,</hi> for about 16 years and more, in all which Service I served <hi>gratis,</hi> without Sallery, as others had. My House was a place of Entertainment for their Teachers for many years together: I suffered Imprisonment at <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Nislech</hi> for their cause, in which I was then Embark'd 3 Years and about 4 Months: I suffered the loss of more than a hundred Pounds for Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting contrary to an Act of Parliament, made the 22 King <hi>Charles</hi> II. besides many other affairs in which I was concern'd whil'st with them: Sometimes chosen to go to <hi>London</hi>-Meetings, sometimes chosen to end some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which happen'd amongst us, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to assist in Marriages, about settlements of Estates in that case, as in the Instance of <hi>William Read</hi> Widower; and the Widow <hi>Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of <hi>Brund,</hi> and divers others, as <hi>Stephen
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199413:83"/> Clackson</hi> and the Widow <hi>Young;</hi> I say put all together, and I think I may venture upon my own experience, to say as much as the Author of the said <hi>Hist.</hi> and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I shall not impose upon my Reader; but in the main of what I shall write, I shall prove from matter of Fact, and then, as he says, shall leave every one to judge as he thinks fit, being at all times ready to appear and maintain what I write according to <hi>G.W.</hi>'s own proposition in his printed Sheet, stiled <hi>The Quakers Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. And when I meet Mr. <hi>Croese</hi> I shall go along with him, in this History, as far as he goes my way, and when he turns aside to the right Hand or to the left, I shall part friendly with him, and deal kindly by him as we us'd to do to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But since his Book came over the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and reflects upon the Government, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly charging the Magistrates with the crime of Persecution, a thing they are much averse to; I shall therefore endeavor to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it, and shew him 'tis not persecution, but prosecution; and to shew that I am not alone in this matter, I received a Letter wrot by a dignifyed Clergy-man of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to a Neighbouring Minister. An Abstract thereof is as followeth, <hi>viz</hi>

                           <hi>GEorge Fox</hi> was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1624. in a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage call'd <hi>Draton</hi> in <hi>Leicestershire;</hi> his Father's Name was <hi>Christopher Fox,</hi> his Mothers Name <hi>Mary,</hi> who gained their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Weaving. This <hi>George</hi> afterwards learned the Trade of a Shoomaker, and wrought Journy-work with <hi>George Gee</hi> of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199413:84"/>
                           <hi>Manchester,</hi> who having gained so much Learning as that he could read print pretty well, but writing he could read but little of, neither could write except very rudely. And this was the only piece of Learning he attained too all his Life long: For neither then nor any time after did he apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to any Liberal Study: So that he not only knew no other Language, save his Mother-Tongue; but even in that he was so little expert, and so ill qualified, either for Speaking or Writing, all the whole course of his Life; that what he understood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, he could not explain or inlarge upon, in any tollerable good <hi>English,</hi> and far less could he deliver it in Writing: And this I thought worth the remarking, because a great many Books are extant in <hi>Geo. Fox</hi>'s Name, writ not only in Letters of English but also in Latin, and interlarded with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of many other Languages which are but little known to the learned World, which whether it was an effect of simplicity in him, or of his Ambition and Ostentation I will not determine, only 'tis plain he had not the gift of Tongues, p. 10. The Quakers Doctrine is for a great part of it New, or taken from some Ancient Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and rejected by the Church, which have lain so long dormant, are revived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new by them; and as to the rest 'tis a medly or hotch-potch diametrically opposite to that of ours, and their manner of Life so singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199413:85"/> from all Christians as possibly can be: And these are the Tenets they have so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily spread both at their first rise, and in the further progress of the Sect; and all that are capable of Speaking or Writing, do diligently apply themselves in all places, to the Explaining, Defending and Propagating their Doctrines, inveighng and railing against the contrary opinions in others, with as bitter and reviling expressions as they can invent. And such their accusatory Libels they disperse abroad into all Countries, p. 11. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Mother and Nurse of the Quakers is <hi>England,</hi> a Country once famous, for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing and Extirpating Heresies, now the Seat and Centre of all manner of Errors, p. 25. Nay when their Number increased they became bolder, going into Peoples Houses when not invited, intruding themselves into company, Litigiously starting Controversies. Thus would they <hi>belch</hi> out ignominious Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Slanders against Religious Men; and especially the Ministers of Churches, p. 26. And now would they publickly appear on the High-ways, in the Market-places, yea enter into Churches and that boldly too; finding fault with the Discourses and Prayers of the Ministers, disparaging and defaming them and their actions with all manner of Insolence and Impudence, p. 32. Charging them to Preach only for love of Lucre and Reward. But in all these controversies he <hi>[George Fox]</hi> never considered how near of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199413:85"/> Kin his own case was unto theirs; for tho' he pretended to take all this pains and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in running about to Preach Gratis, yet those he Preached to, supplyed his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before he ask'd it of them, at least-wise he never was denyed the Liberty of coming uncall'd for (as the Flies) and like (Mice) feeding upon others Provision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Upon the like Crimes, there was a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not long after by the Gentlemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the County, as Quoted by <hi>George Fox,</hi> in his Book stiled <hi>Saul's Errand to Damascus,</hi> &amp;c. And by reason the Author of the <hi>Gen. Hist.</hi> is pleased first to mention it, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the Quakers, to whom he had not long before given their due correction. First re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the principal part of the said Petition. <hi>Gen. Hist.</hi> p. 103. saith. <q>But yet, as they left nothing that was objected against them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Answer, so did they also confute this (Petition) in their Writings, in such a manner, and with such Reasons, that it was very apparent that they were wicked Men who invented these things, and that those who believed them were Fools, excepting the Prophesies of <hi>Milner,</hi> the vanity of whose
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199413:87"/> Words they willingly acknowledg'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved — and overthrew these Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And when I have thus done, I doubt not but it will appear, that they have rather own'd the Charges than denyed them; and that instead of confuting, they are still most obnoxious to them: And that there is no apparent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons given why they were wicked Men that charged the Blasphemies upon them, nor Fools that believed it, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Defence,</hi> As he is held forth in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Letter without them, as in the Flesh without them; he is their Example or Figure which is both one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obser.</hi> Then Christ in the days of his Flesh was but a Figure; his Death and Sufferings a Figure; his Resurrection and Ascension a Figure of the Quakers Light within them; his Death within them; his Crucifixion and Resurrection within them: This is perfect Blasphemy, and infallible Quakerism.</p>

                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:199413:89"/>7. Charge, Ja.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Defence, George Fox</hi> said; as for <hi>Ja.

                        <hi>Obser.</hi> I am the longer on this Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it contains all the Pillars upon which Quakerism stands, <hi>Gen.

                     <p n="8">8. Charge, Leo Fell <hi>said that Christ had no other Body but his Church.</hi>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Obser. John Whitehead, Joshua Coal,</hi> and as many of them as have spake honestly what they believe, have said and wrote the same.</p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:199413:90"/>
                     <p>Read the Gen. History of the Quakers, p. 102. 103. where the Historian is pleased to say, the Quakers left nothing unanswer'd: They confuted these Charges of Blasphemy, with such Reasons, that it is apparent (saith he,) they are wicked Men that said so, and Fools that believed it, altho' the very Man <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> himself, gives the whole Relation: And I affirm, there is not one Charge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered or taken off as it ought to be, but rather all confessed: I must confess <hi>G. W.</hi> I believe is asham'd of his Brother <hi>Fox,</hi> and of his Brother <hi>Milner</hi>'s Blasphemy; but yet cannot, nay, will not condemn the Book; they have said it and will stand to it, which puts me in mind of a story I once heard of a Woman whose Son was going out Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, even at the Door; hold said his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have something to say, pray have a care of Lying, yea said the Son; ay said She my Son, I charge you not to tell a lye, and the Lad going out, stay Son said the Woman, I say again, be sure you do not tell Lies, but if it happen at any time that you do tell a Lye, be sure you stand in it, and so farewel.</p>
                     <p>The Quakers say in print, that he that hath the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with God; <hi>He</hi> yea <hi>He,</hi> the Man; and all the Quakers that hear of this Book, I am persuaded [because the World's People have got it] would wish it were burnt; yet for a thousand Worlds they would not have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:199413:90"/> the World know they burn it, so beloved a Point is Infallibility.</p>
                     <p>The Quakers say in print, that 'tis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration to speak out of the Scriptures, and not a Quaker is to be found that will condemn it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>George Fox</hi> said he was before all Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were, and not a <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quaker in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will condemn it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>George Fox</hi> said that neither He nor his Name was known in the World, not a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker found to deny it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>George Fox</hi> said he heard the Thundering Voice from Heaven saying, I have glorifyed thee, and will glorify thee again; but not a Quaker found to condemn this Blasphemy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>George Fox</hi> said he was Christ, the Way, the Truth, and the Life; not a Quaker found to condemn it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Edward Burrow</hi> said that the Sufferings of the Quakers are greater, and more unjust, than the Sufferings of Christ, his Apostles and Martyrs; not a Quaker found to condemn this Book. I except the late separate Quakers both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could enumerate a hundred Blasphemies like these, but the Quakers cannot condemn one. Thus did Quakerism rise, thus did it grow, and by these principles hath it taken a deep root, and made a large progress: These principles are Antichristian, they are Antiscriptural. Oh! that these poor deluded People would once come to consider of them, and condemn them: If not, my Hand shall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:199413:91"/> not spare, nor my Eye pity, neither will I keep back any thing that may discover their dangerous Errors: Who knows but their Children may see, and seeing may abhor these most horrible Blasphemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fox</hi>'s Journal is full, take a Tast of them as followeth. p. 37. Wife (said the Goaler) I have seen the Day of Judgment, and I saw <hi>George Fox</hi> there, and then going to <hi>George</hi> said, I have been as a Lyon to you, but now I shall be like a Lamb.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obser.</hi> And great reason for it; for <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> whether the poor Goaler knew it, before he saw the Judgment day and <hi>Fox</hi> there; I say whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knew it, he said he was the Eternal judge of the World, and therefore it was time for the Goaler to come to him Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, as the Goaler came to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> Trembling, p. 45. A Trooper at Church heard a Voice from Heaven, go to my Servant <hi>[George Fox]</hi> for direction, so I [said <hi>Fox</hi>] spake to his condition, and his understanding was opened.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:199413:92"/> these Quakers have been so often used, as that they were left half dead; for no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample can be produced of any of their deaths the same Moment, or in a short time after. Again, p. 117. They made it their business to defame and heap up scandalous Reproaches upon the Credit, Fame and Reputation of the Magistrates and Pastors of the Church, in those most bitter Letters to their Friends; and such practices as these did the Quakers extol as Noble doings, and Glorious actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, p. 97. And others in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Libels cast all manner of Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon those Magistrates before all Men, and imprecated all Evils upon them, and as it were, pronounce them by the command of God; forgetting the Monitor and Author of that saying; that we should daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our own Failings, and love our Enemies.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which relation I find the Historian very partial; for certainly, never did People am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie their Sufferings, and conceal their own Crimes, like the Quakers; never so Insolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defame both Magistracy and Ministry, and extol themselves and their actions like the Quakers. And that the World may see Mr. <hi>Croese</hi> is in the right, I shall cite some few Instances of the Titles of their Books, as a demonstration to confirm what Mr. <hi>Croese</hi> hath said, with some little matter out of some of them, as well as some observations upon them: But I cannot enlarge least I swell my Book beyond my intention, which is only to

                     <p>I forbear to recite their proofs, but by the Title aforesaid 'tis easie to see their Insolence, Impudence, and Arrogancy: That a dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting People should thus Arraign, Try, and Condemn the national Ministry to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the Ministers of Christ, and to agree and concur with all the false Prophets and Deceivers. This is such a Charge as is worthy observation; and yet if they be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, oh! how they take it? Witness their Books against me for Arraigning them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> next <hi>Burrow's Works,</hi> p. 523. <q>why, they see that the wicked Clergy's Interest is more prospering than the just freedom of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And this I say unto you (the Parliament) in the Name of the Lord, that whil'st that interest of the Priesthood is so much favour'd and defended you can never prosper, nor the Nations be happy under you; for it is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199413:93"/> one of the greatest Oppressions this day of the Nation, the maintaining and upholding of this Ministry by Tythes, and the very Land groans under the Oppression of this Church and Ministry, which lies as a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthen, both upon Persons and Estates, and Consciences of many good People, even of your dearest Friends: Their own doings are a sufficient Testimony of the malice of their Hearts against you, and all good Men in the Nation; yet nevertheless some of you seem to shut your Eyes, crying up your Godly Ministers; and thus are you blinded and see not were the Cause lies of your interruptions; I say 'tis the favouring of that Interest which stops the issue of good things, and while you oppress peoples Persons, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and Consciences to uphold this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry and Priesthood aforesaid, the Lord shall never prosper you, nor make the Nations happy under your charge; wherefore I do say unto you, it is high time for you to lay aside the Interest of this oppressing Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy so much levened of the Whore of <hi>Rome;</hi> your selves do know that the Spirit of the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy was in the late Bishops, which you cast out for their wickedness, and the very Spirit of those Bishops is entered into these Priests, and bears Rule in their Hearts, and thus by succession, hath the Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> levened the Clergy of <hi>England.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clear your selves; do not any longer Drink the Whores Cup, neither be you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199413:93"/> of her, and leave this false Church and Ministry to themselves; for while you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and uphold this Ministry, Church and Worship, you do but cause People to drink the Whores Cup; and you are but them which carry the Whore, <hi>viz.</hi> the false Church, and this is plain dealing to tell you the truth, whether you will reject it or receive it: Wherefore cast them off, and let them not lurk under your Wings, for one day they will rebel against you, and another day flatter you; and for a season they will shew forth much love and kindness to you in Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy; you had better be in a just opposition against them, than in an unjust peace with them. I know it appears to many of you a thing very hard to be born; what! to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake our Godly Ministers think ye? to hear tell of laying them aside is an amasement to some of your minds; was it not the same concerning the King and Bishops? Was it not as much terrible to him and his Lords, and Councils to think of the overthrow of the then called Godly Fathers and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; but better had he cast them off and saved himself, than to have perished with them; for I tell you again, that the very Spirit of the old Idolatrous Bishops is ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Hearts of these Men, and there is as great a measure of Tyranny and Injustice, and Abomination lying upon these, as once was upon the Bishops; and these are no less free from the abomination than they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199413:94"/> were, and these are nigh as ripe for Vengeance, <hi>&amp;c. Burrows Epistle,</hi> &amp;c. And the word of the Lord we sounded and did not spare, &amp; caused the deaf to hear, and the blind to see, and the dread of the Lord went before us and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, and terror took hold on our Enemies. And first of all our mouths were opened, and and our Spirits filled with indignation against the Priests and Teachers, and with them and against them we first began to War, as being the causers of the People to err, and the blind leaders that carried the blind into the Ditch; and against them as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all wickedness abounding in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as being the issue of Profaness, and against them we cryed, shewing unto all these People that they were not lawful Ministers of Christ, but Deceivers and Antichrists; and we spared not publickly, and at all seasons, to utter forth the Judgments of the Lord against them, and their Ways, and their Churches, and Worships, and Practices; and this was our first Work we entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to thresh down the Deceivers and lay them open, that all People may see their shame and come to turn from them.</q>

                     <p>Reader I gave you an account of their Rise, and when, and now of their Progress, and how. These are the Sayings of <hi>Edw.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199413:94"/> And the whole community own, stand by, and at all turns are ready to defend my Lord chief Justice <hi>Burrow's,</hi> who you see, first by a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful Tryal</hi> hath <hi>arraigned</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> the Clergy by wholesale, and for a crime, if it were true, would deserve it too, tho' not from them, <hi>viz.</hi> being contrary to all the Ministers of Christ, in all things, and according to all the false Prophets and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in all things; oh dreadful! You see also their Petition to the Parliament, it needs no comment; they plead heartily against the Clergy, against their Interest, against their Tythes; they tell the Parliament they can never prosper, if they do not throw off the wicked Clergy; leave them to themselves, stand in a just opposition to them; that their first Work was to make War against the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as the Deceivers of the Nation, the Issue of Prophaness, yea, the Fountain of <hi>all</hi> Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness; and with them, and against them they first began to War; for their Mouths were filled with indignation against them [I believe them;] and in all Places, publick and private; in Churches, in Markets, on the high Ways, and in private Meetings; oh how did they lay them open? But Reader give me leave to insist now largly on this Head, it being the Quakers Master-piece.</p>

                        <q>Now I come to declare who are true Judges of Heresie and Hereticks; None are able to discern of Heresie, nor to Try and Judge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:199413:95"/> rightly who are Hereticks; none but they [I say] that have the infallible Spirit of God in them to guide them, and have infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfect certainty of Judgment and Knowledge in that case of Heresie: None else, I say, are rightly able to judge who are Hereticks; But such as have the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit of Christ, and are infallible and certain in their judgment; these only, and none else, are able to judge; they only are competent judges in this case of Heresie, and who are Hereticks. It is but out of Envy, if they have not the infallible Spirit of God, and infallibility of Judgment to discern by, for no Man can justly judge another in the matter of Heresie, as a Heretick by their own Thoughts or Suppositions, for the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that matter must be Just, Equal, Holy, and True, and only by the Spirit of Jesus Christ which is infallible, and gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of judgment and discerning into all Cases and Things: For it was Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus and his Apostles and the Saints that had the infallible Spirit of God, and infallibility of Judgment. The <hi>Jews</hi> could not judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had not the infallible Spirit of Judgment, nor the certain infallible Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor can the Christians: There's none can truly discern, nor justly judge what He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie is, nor who is a Heretick, but such as are guided by the infallible Spirit of Christ, and have infallibility of Judgment: So both the Law-makers and the Judges of the Law

                     <p>I think I have said enough of their infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as it lies in half a page; in their Book stiled the <hi>Antichrists Government detected,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>By which the Quakers boldly Impeach all Parliaments and Courts of Judicature.

                        <hi>Truth,</hi> I shall try them in order, and if I find them right in the ground, shall approve them, if not, testify against them; therefore speak plainly what thy Church is that I may proceed to Tryal.</p>

                        <hi>Truth,</hi> now I shall try thy Church, and if it be not in God it is none of his, but an adulterated Harlot covered over with the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Iniquity; therefore <hi>Tradition</hi> be silent a little and <hi>Truth</hi> will shew thee thy Error; so be cool and hear what <hi>Truth</hi> saith, for now thy Church comes to Tryal.</p>

                        <hi>Tradition,</hi> I know that Praying in my Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is right, for it is mentioned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and was practiced very much by the Saints; and I have the Lord's Prayer, and have made many other Prayers which be useful and comfortable for all conditions, and on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; and I have put them together in a Book which I call the Book of Common Prayer, and use it in my Devotion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Truth,</hi> Prayer in the Spirit the Saints pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed, but thou art degenerated and hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med such Prayers as the Lord hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, neither doth he open his Ear to them; and that which thou call'st the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, be thou silent and make no mention of it, for thou hast nothing to do with it; — Oh thou Adulterous <hi>Tradition!</hi> What Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous births hast thou brought forth?

And who first divided unto them their several Diocesses, and appointed them to Rule within their own Diocess? And who first made Deans and Prebends, Doctors, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars, and Curates, and who gave them their Names? And who first set up certain Places for Schools? And who gave them the Names of Universities? And how came they to be call'd <hi>Christ</hi>'s Colledge, and <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>John</hi>'s Colledge, and <hi>Jesus</hi>'s Colledge? And who set up Commencements and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:199413:100"/> that a Man must be made Batchelor of Art, and Master of Art, before he can be approv'd to be made a Minister in thy Order? And who first made that Law which forces and compels the payment of the Tenth part of things encreased, to such a Ministry, and whether are such the Ministers of Christ, who make use of that Law to force their maintenance? Are these thy Bishops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters which thou say'st there can be nothing said against them? Open thine Eye and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, for they are <hi>Monsters</hi> which from thy adulterous Conception are brought forth, and they are stamped with thy Image, and all thy abominations are denyed and testified against; this is a Charge against thee.</p>

                     <p>Reader, marvel not too much at the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of this Man, for it is the Heart of Quakerism: He was a right Quaker and no Mungril, and Eminent Teacher, and a ready Sail.

                     <p>I think this is so bold, as well as base, that it need no comment: But if they look into the Cage, I presume, they'll find little cause to boast, especially if I give them the right Key to open it, and that amongst their Teachers and Writers; but if I should make a Cage for their Hearers, ir would be much enlarged every way.</p>

                     <p>Reader, the reason why I have insisted so long on this Head. beyond my first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, threefold; 1st. to shew <hi>W. Penn</hi> by his 3 first Books in his Protestant Dress, and by his last six, with his Mask off in the contrary Dress. 2. That by comparing his last six Books with the Quakers Addresses to the late K. <hi>J.</hi> II. from their Anniversary Synods, you will see they run in one and the same Channel, issuing from one and the same Fountain; especially when you consider that from their said yearly Meetings they never made one Address to his present Majesty, nor wrot one Book in favour of the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. 3. That by both their Addresses a Sample of them you'll have by and by, and by their Books they have joyntly and severally born against the Church of <hi>England</hi> as with one Shoulder. Thus have I briefly shewed what a Writer <hi>W.

Thus by his counterfeit Miracles, his gift of Tongues, he still like <hi>Simon Magus</hi> gave out that he was some great Man; for thus he wrot in the Introduction, viz. <hi>All Languages are to me no more than Dust, who was before Languages were,</hi> &amp;c. and towards the end of the Book thus; <hi>next follow a few words to the whole matter by</hi> George Fox, <hi>who is before confusion and many Languages were,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:199413:111"/> This, together with what I elsewhere have quoted out of his Books and Journals, shew that he was willing to be esteemed a great Man, an old Man, a learned Man, a wise Man, an Angel, one that see the Heavens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> did, and much more to this purpose: By all which it appears, that he was a great Deceiver. And thus Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism grew, and by deceit prevail'd in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress: And since this learned Author hath given such a full proof of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Pride, who being an Ignorant Fellow, as he stiles him, and yet desirous to be taken for the Author of the said Battle-door, containing Thirty Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. I will give him a third Instance, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1659. <hi>George Fox</hi> puts forth a Book, Entituled <hi>A Primmer</hi> (in contempt of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) <hi>for all the Doctors and Scholars in</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein are contained 2434 Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this Method, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>What is a Participle, what is it in it self, and by whom it came, and out of what Ground? And why are these declined; who was the First and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, and by whom it came? And why is the Word called Adverb, and what is an Adverb, the word it self, and who was its rise? And why do you call the word Conjunction? and who was its rise? and why the word Preposition? and who was its rise? And who was the Author of the word Interjection? and what are these two words in themselves, and whether or no these did not come by the Art of Man? What is a Vowel in it self, and what was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:199413:112"/> the word Vowel? And what is the word Diphthong, and who was the Author of these, and where are they called by such Names in Scripture? so who was the Author of these Names in themselves, and of themselves, and came they not from the Art of Man, yea or nay? Why do you call the word Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, Feminine, Neuter, and Epicene; and what was the ground of these words in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? What are they, and why do they use the word Declension? and what is in the word it self, and what was its root? And why the word Comparative, Positive, and Superlative? and what be these words as they are words? of what Author and Root came they from, and who gave them these Terms first? who was the first Rise and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Thus have I taken out six entire Paragraphs as they lye in the said Primmer; but I profess I cannot answer these, why then should I cite more: I cannot tell who spake these words first, no more than I can tell who spake the word [to] first; or spake the word [and] first, and who was the first Rise and Author of the word [of] which to know is as unnecessary, as it is ridiculous to query: Well take a few more as they lye scattered up and down the said Primmer. <q>What is a Major? What is a Minor? What is Extraction? What is Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry? What is Dog-madness? What is Badger-madness? and what is Wolf mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay, what if I add one query; what was <hi>Fox</hi>-madness and folly; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:199413:112"/> was not Pride and Ambition the Author of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Madness, answer <hi>G. W.</hi>
                        </q> Having thus far proceeded, I shall next recite a few of <hi>Fox</hi>'s words by way of challenge to the Doctors and Scholars, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>These queries are to call you out into the Field; let them come out now to little Children; little <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> are risen, who have the <hi>Bags</hi> and the <hi>Slings,</hi> and the Stones; yea, that profess your selves to be Wise and Learned Men, and Scholars, and are Novices and Fools; Answer me; draw out your Weapon if you have any, and Answer me these things; come out of your holes, do not <hi>hip</hi> nor <hi>skip</hi> from them; answer every word in particular, for you have Tongue enough sometimes, let us see now if it can wag, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Reader, this is one way by which they deceived the simple, and thereby Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism had its progress.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gen. Hist.</hi> 112. The Form of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Confession before the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was, <q>I believe with my Heart, and confess with my Mouth the Sacred Scriptures to be Divine, left us by Men Inspired by God, as an exact rule of our Faith and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; and I profess to believe in one only God who is the Father, and in Jesus Christ his Eternal Son, very God, and very Man; and in the Holy Spirit, one and the same God with the Father and Son, blessed for evermore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I must confess this Confession, if sincere, is there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:199413:113"/> somewhat to the purpose; but if sincere then there is a vast Change in their Minds, both from their frequent disputations, as well as their printed Books; and because we cannot well try them by the first, therefore we will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Sincerity by the latter; and if their Books teach the contrary, then until they first condemn those Books, we have no ground to believe them sincere in what they say to serve a turn; I will at this time quote only two of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Sword of the Lord drawn,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 5. <q>Your imagined God beyond the Stars, and your carnal Christ is utterly denyed and testifyed against by the Light; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you [the Priest] say, that Christ is God and Man in one Person, it is a lye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, if they believe as they write; how can they be sincere in what they say, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove? for contraries cannot be the same; white is not black, neither is black white; Men never gathered Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of Thistles; ye shall know them [<hi>i. e.</hi> Deceivers] said Christ by their Fruit; this is an infallible rule. Again,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>News coming up out of the North,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 14. <q>Your original is carnal, Hebrew, Greek and Latin; and your Word is carnal; the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Light is carnal; the Letter, their original is but Dust, which is but the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is Death; and their Gospel is Dust; <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> which is but the Letter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:199413:113"/>
                     <p>So then, if the Scriptures be Dust, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Serpents-Meat, how are they Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; nay, how were they given forth by Divine Inspiration? What did <hi>George Fox</hi> mean? Divine Dust, Divine Food for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; a Divine Carnal Letter. No sure: Then doubtless these expressions were cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures by way of contempt, against such as professed them to be given by Divine Inspiration; and that they were in earnest the rule of our Faith and Behaviour, against which the Quakers have both Preached and Disputed this 40 years, as I can make appear by 40 of their Books now by me. One more I shall quote to strengthen what I say. How then can they be sincere in this their Confession? How can they at one and the same time believe the Scriptures are Death, Dust, Beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ware, Serpents Food, and also that they are Divine and left us by Men Inspired of God for the rule of our Faith and Practice; I say, how can these contraries be reconciled; nay, it's impossible. If they shall say in answer to what I now affirm, that their Minds are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally changed and better informed I could be heartily glad of it; but then let us have a sign of it, and some ground to believe them, <hi>viz.</hi> Let them condemn these Books that Teach contrary to their Confession; for whil'st then I boldly aver, to those who know them and their Doctrine, and their Books [which they prefer above the Scriptures,] they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:199413:114"/> they are not to be believ'd. The Book I mention to cite is this:</p>

                        </q> Oh horrible and unheard of; and in this Book there are the Names of <hi>George Fox, Thomas Lawson, Thomas Aldham, Benjamen Nicolson, John Harrwood,</hi> five of their primitive Teachers and notable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</p>
                     <p>Behold the way, manner, and method of the growth and progress of Quakerism; what, shall this be encourag'd? shall this be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd in a Christian Nation, God forbid? Here is contempt cast upon the Scripture, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ministry, upon the Magistracy, and People; no matter for their confession whil'st these Books stand uncondemned; they keep these Books in their Families, read them and recommend them, as elsewhere I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Even as <hi>Arias</hi> kept his opinion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and yet deceitfully signed as fair a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to please the Emperor <hi>Constantine;</hi> which is as followeth. See <hi>Hist. Socrates,</hi> cap. 38. <hi>Viz.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <q>I believe in one God the Father Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in Jesus Christ his Son; who was made by him before all Ages, God the Word by whom all things in Heaven and Earth were made; who came down and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:199413:115"/> who suffered and rose again, and ascended, and shall come to judge the quick and the dead; and in the Holy Ghost, the Resurrection of the Flesh, and the Life to come; in one Catholick Church of God from one end of the World to another; this we believe as God shall judge us now and in the World to come.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperor was a good Man, and thought him sincere, and accepted of it; but the cheat lay here, which afterwards was found out; he wrote a Paper of what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believed, and said he believed as he had written; and the Quakers have wrot Books that for any to say that Christ is God and Man in one Person is a lye, and therefore they cannot believe that Christ is very God and very Man, but believe as they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. They also have written, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are Death, Dust, Serpents-meat, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Beastly Ware; and though they have made a confession that the Scriptures are Divine, and left by Men Inspired of God; and that they are a rule of Faith and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; yet they believe also that <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> was divinely Inspired and wrote from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; so they believe as they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: If any think I wrong them, let their Books be laid before them which I have cited, and let them be asked. Come which do you abide by? which do contain your Faith and Belief? Do you believe as you have confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? if you do, at the same time condemn
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:199413:115"/> your other Books which teach the contrary; if you say no, our Books are writ from the Eternal Spirit of God we cannot condemn them, then condemn your confession, for we will not have you halt between two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; if God be God serve him; if <hi>Baal</hi> serve him. This will be the Test, which were it put to them, you would soon see them to be Quakers still, and not Christians yet: And so I proceed to the next Head.</p>

                        <q>There was one <hi>John Jay</hi> being to try a Horse got upon his back; and the Horse fell a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cast him down upon his Head, and break his neck, as the people said. They that were near him took him up dead and carried him a good way, and laid him on a Tree: <hi>I</hi> got to him as soon as <hi>I</hi> could, and feeling on him concluded he was dead; and as <hi>I</hi> stood by him pitying him and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>I</hi> took hold of his Hair, and his Head turned any way his Head was so limber; whereupon throwing away <hi>my</hi> Stick, and <hi>my</hi> Gloves, <hi>I</hi> took his Head in both my Hands, and setting <hi>my</hi> knees against the Tree <hi>I</hi> raised his Head, and perceiving there was nothing out or broken that way, then <hi>I</hi> put one Hand under his Chin, and <hi>my</hi> other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his Head, and raising his Head two or three times with all <hi>my</hi> Strength and brought it in, <hi>I</hi> soon perceived his Neck began to grow stiff again, and then he began to rattle in the Throat, and quickly after to breath; the People were amazed, but <hi>I</hi> bid them have a good Heart, and be of good Faith, and carry him into the House; they did so, and set him by the Fire, but <hi>I</hi> bid them get him some warm thing to drink and put him to Bed. After he had been in the House a while,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:199413:116"/> he began to speak, but did not know where he had been the next day. We passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and he with us, about 16 Miles to a Meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And amongst the rest this being the chief, and to me seem most remarkable, I have set it down at large; and whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, 1. That it was wrought in his own Name <hi>I, I, I,</hi> did so and so, and not as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did, <hi>In the name of Jesus of Nazareth arise,</hi> no, no, <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> like <hi>Simon Magus</hi> wrought counterfeit Miracles in his own Name only. 2. This is said to be done in 1672. and brought to light but in 1694 which is 22 years after it was said to be done; and there let me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and see how far they run parallel, read Acts 8.9, 10. <q>There was a certain Man called <hi>Simon,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time in the same City used Sorcery, and bewitched the People of <hi>Samaria;</hi> giving out that <hi>himself</hi> was some <hi>great one,</hi> to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying, this Man is the great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This account the Holy Apostle gives on him, next let us hear what <hi>Justin Martin</hi> said of this <hi>Simon,</hi> viz.</p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:199413:117"/>
                     <p>
                        <q>Many adored him as the supreme God; they gave heed to him; they believed and obeyed what he Taught; they placed their hopes and confidence in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> See <hi>Pools</hi> Synopsis of the Criticks, p. 14. 62. <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his paraphrase on that place, saith, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>A Man there was among the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> called <hi>Simon,</hi> a Deceiver of the People, and a Practicer of Delusions; who before <hi>Philip</hi> came there, practiced in that City Magick-Art, and by his <hi>counterfeit Miracles</hi> had made the <hi>Samaritans</hi> fond of him, who by means of such falshood and deceit vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himself before the simple and plain Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, boasting that himself was an excellent Prophet, unto whom the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> from the highest to the lowest gave good heed; <hi>But nothing had he done in the name of Jesus:</hi> And therefore they as a People astonished at such monsterous sights said, this Fellow is God's own right hand, who is called Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Many a day had he been with them, and long had he made them, with his Sorcery, to dote upon him; and therefore when he had once gotten himself a name with them of great estimation, many believed all he Taught.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From whence we may observe, by way of parallel, 1. That this <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer was a great while, and many days with the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans;</hi> so was <hi>George Fox</hi> with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. 2. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> wrought counterfeit Miracles in his own Name only, and never
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:199413:117"/> in the Name of Jesus; so did <hi>George Fox,</hi> and thereby (like <hi>Simon</hi>) got himself a great Name of estimation amongst the Quakers. 3. That the <hi>Samaritans</hi> adored <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and call'd him the power of God; so did the Quakers, whil'st living, witness <hi>Josiah Coal</hi>'s Letter, and others in the first part recited, and now dead, they have printed him to be the power of God, saying, Miracles wrought by the power of God. Third Table under the Letrer M and for more of this Nature, see his Journal p. 167. 170, 103, 28, 29, 258, 370. where he would make us believe he was an Angel; that he saw the Heaven opened; that he was seen at the Judgment Day; that he cured the Sick, restored the Lame, and wrought many other Miracles which will complete the parallel.</p>
                     <p>But this story of <hi>John Jay</hi> is surely as idle, and unworthy of being esteemed a Miracle, as any thing can be found in the Popish Legends; for if setting a Man's Neck aright, that had gone awry by a fall, be a Miracle, then many Miracles have been wrought in <hi>England</hi> and elsewhere, for it is very common, and yet was never called a Miracle until now, that these who published his Journal, have so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it; and like to this is, that one recovered from Sickness, after <hi>G. Fox</hi> had prayed, and if this was a Miracle, many such Miracles are wrought by Ministers of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and others.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Divers particulars contracted out of the General History, and branched into six distinct Heads, where their Anniversary Synods, and their Church Government, and private Devotions are Treated of; shewing the effects to be disparaging the Scripture, withholding Tythes, refusing to pay Church Rates; neglecting to read the Bible in their Meetings; refusing to vindicate it from the aspersions of the Papists; throwing of the Sacraments; allowing Women to Teach and Ʋsurp Authority, in their distinct Womens Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; omitting private Duties; censuring and reproaching the Church Liturgy, Magistrates, Ministers, such as write against them, and for Conscience sake separate from them; their gross Hypocrisy, in making Legal punishments to be persecutions; in saying and recording that they suffer great penalties, when they really do not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>GEN. Hist. p.</hi> 50. <hi>to</hi> 56. <q>They (the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) have likewise Meetings like to those we call <hi>Classes,</hi> and Provincial and National Synods or Councils; these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions are celebrated, but so as to allot each Sex, both Men and Women, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and particular Meetings, other Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are appointed every Month; others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very three Months; in which they consider their Provincial affairs: In these they inspect
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:199413:118"/> into, and recognize all Books that are to be printed, after they have been perused and approved by the Censors appointed for that purpose. The Acts of these Meetings are put into Registers; they have Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Synods in every considerable Kingdom, to whom belong the Care and Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Affairs of that Kingdom. In <hi>England</hi> (their Metropolis) they have a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Anniversary Synod on the third day of Penticost, continuing sittting 4 or 5 days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. They have Delegates also come to this Synod, from all their Churches, in all Counties or Places where the Quakers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain footing; but these must be such as are in the Ministry. At this Meeting they make a Catalogue of the Sufferers for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, discovering what their Sufferings were, and for what causes they were inflicted [and by whom;] when the Synods are dismissed all their Acts and Decisions are enregister'd by the publick Authority of the Synod, which are afterwards copyed from the Records in order to be printed and sent to all the Synods of their Associates <hi>throughout the World.</hi> They have no <hi>President</hi> to their Synod, which place say they, is supplyed by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> but they have a Clark who marks down every thing moved by the Assembly. Moreover, it is their custome in their Houses never to express a Religious Duty with an outward voice; as Praying to God, craving a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:199413:119"/> e'er they take Meat or go to Bed, till they feel the impulsion of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having contracted the sense of several pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wherein my Author relate the Way, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Method of the Quakers Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Family Behaviour; now I shall make it my business to shew how Quakerism grows, encreases, and makes its progress in and by these Ways and Methods; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by discover not only that Quakerism tends to root up the Foundations of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ, who so loved the World, that he laid down his precious Life for lost Man, but also tends to unhinge the Government both of Church and State; and in order to make some further discovery hereof, I shall digest the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a few Heads, and speak briefly and distinctly to each in their place.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Quakers in their Synods have no President; the Holy Ghost supplying that Office.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Quakers at their Synods make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of them which suffer for their Religion, what they suffer, and by whom.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Quakers at their Synods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Books to be printed, and recognize the same.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. About the Womens distinct Meetings, and their way of Government.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Quakers custome observed in not Praying to God in their Families, nor craving a blessing before they Eat.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:199413:119"/>6. About their Anniversary Synods, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that at <hi>London,</hi> with some of its Fruits and Effects.</p>
                     <p>And lastly with some observations upon a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in the General History p. 110. <q>The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers also could not but Love King <hi>William,</hi> and embrace him as their most effectual Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so shall conclude these seven particulars.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> The Quakers have no President in their Synod, which place they say is supplyed by the Holy Ghost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the great Foundation upon which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> build their Faith, touching the Doctrine of infallibility; and of which they mightily boast over all Protestant Churches: For, tho' all true Protestants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Holy Ghost is with, and will continue with his Church to the end of the World, according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. yet that thereby any Synod, Councel, or Church is infallible in their Precepts and Councels; that as such, they are to be indispensably obeyed, as was the Precepts of the inspired Apostles; this they deny; and none hold it but the Papists and Quakers: And as this vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of infallibility in the Papists has been refuted, so it will be in the Quakers also; and in order to it let us examine how, and in what manner the Holy Ghost is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of the Quakers Counsels and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is written John 5.23. <hi>For the Father judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man, but hath committed all judgment to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:199413:120"/> the Son</hi> v. 27. <hi>and hath given him Authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man:</hi> And to this agrees that Apostolical say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>Because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</hi> Now this Text in St. <hi>John</hi> the Quakers do not like it as translated, and therefore to bend the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to serve their design, and to quadrate to their principles, they have perverted these Scriptures in <hi>Josiah Coal</hi> s Works p. 93. saying; <q>All Judgment being committed to the Light that Lighteth every Man, the Light that is in every Man, must of necessity be Judge of all controversies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> So that, it plainly appears from hence, as also in my First Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the First Part. That whereas God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath committed all Judgment to the Son; and hath ordained him to be Judge of quick and dead, because he is the Son of Man. Therefore the Quakers translate this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from the Son of God, Christ Jesus, to their Light, which by their Logick is the Son of Man which I deny; and this Light to whom they say all Judgment is committed, and which they have in them, must be Judge of all controversies, and consequently their President, which deserves the casting Voice. No marvel then that the Quakers are not concern'd to vindicate our Bible against the contempt cast upon it by the Papists, as saith
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:199413:120"/> the same <hi>Josiah Coal</hi> ibid. p. 104. <q>I find the rest of his Book [<hi>i. e. A. S.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick] consists of divers Arguments, in which he controverts with Sectaries, and their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Ministers whose cause I am not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in; therefore it doth not concern me to Answer his Charges against them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> No, what neither <hi>Sectaries,</hi> their <hi>Bibles</hi> nor <hi>Ministers?</hi> Surely tho' he thought himself not engag'd to vindicate the Sectaries, nor their Ministers; yet, if as they pretend to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they do believe the Scriptures to be Divine, and lest us by Men Divinely Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and that they are a rule of Faith and Behaviour, they ought to have vindicated the Bible at least. Well, but some may say what did this <hi>A. S.</hi> the Papists call the Bible, that they the Quakers think themselves thus unconcern'd to vindicate. I Answer, 'tis his 14th Chapter, and which the same <hi>Josiah Coal</hi> hath printed, as an Abettor and Co-workers with him in p. 113. to 116 of his Works. The contempt the Papists cast on the Bible, and which the Quakers are not at all concern'd to vindicate is, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Protestant Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarian Ministers and Preachers, who stand in a Pulpit or Tub,</hi> with such a brazen Fac'd Book as is their unjust, corrupt, and perverse Bible in their hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh the deceit of this People! What do they pretend to own the Bible only for their own ends, to obtain their Liberty? and when the Papists vilifie and contemn it, and call
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:199413:121"/> it a brazen Fac'd Book, a corrupt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Book, and they not concern'd hereat: Well, I do still hope that some will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to vindicate the Holy Bible from the contempt of the Papists, calling it a brazen Fac'd Book, perverse Book; and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Quakers who call it Death, Dust, Beastly ware, Carnal, Serpents-meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Quakers at their Synods make Catalogues of Sufferers for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and what they Suffer, and by whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have spoken to this Head largely in the 4th Chapter of the first Part, and therein shewed how they boast of their Sufferings; how they Augment and make them more than they are; yea, put them in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents Sufferers 20 <hi>l.</hi> when they are so far from that, that they have gotten 10 <hi>l.</hi> clear into pocket, as in the case of <hi>Samuel Cater.</hi> I have made it appear likewise, as my Author says, <hi>Gen. Hist.</hi> p. 137. that they amplify their Sufferings, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>A scratch, a pinch, or a blue spot for a grievous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bloody Wound, which may be well observed in most of the Monuments which these Men have left of their Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> That the Quakers inspect their Books to be printed after approved by their Censors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From whence let it be noted, that if their Books be thus inspected and approved by their approved Censors then are the whole answerable for the Errors contained in those Books, and for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:199413:121"/> all the horrible Blasphemies in them. But their case is still worse; for suppose any one or more of them, be moved as he pretends to write a Message, Warning or Exhortation to a Nation, People, or Society, as the Word of the Lord God, their frequent pretence. This Book is first sent up to <hi>London</hi> for inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and approbation, to one of these Meetings or Synods; where their Light is <hi>President,</hi> and made infallible Judge, having all Judgment committed to it in Heaven and in Earth: this Synod thus Assembled shall afterwards vary the Title and change the Matter to make it harmonize with their design; and when this Writer Dyes and leaves 20 or 30 Books thus approved, and thus sent abroad; the survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Synod shall take these Books, and again alter them; put in and take out a second time what they please, then re-print them again: And what is become of their Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility now? They had their President at their first inspection; what, could he not then see and discern clearly? but that here must be a new inspection? was not their President [their Light] the same? For, either the Quakers write as they are moved by the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, or they do not; if they do, then they are equal with the Apostles Writings, and then the Judgment denounced <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. <hi>If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto them the plagues that are written in this Book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:199413:122"/> God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book,</hi> &amp;c. This reward they must expect; Again, if they do not, then are they most horrible Deluders and great Deceivers when they write thus, <hi>this is the word of the Lord God to you the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of</hi> Bristol, or the like; and they believe it not; they do not believe the Author to be so moved and commissioned; and forasmuch as they served the Works of <hi>Edward Burrow, W. Smith, George Fox, Is. Pennington;</hi> so <hi>viz.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, added and diminished to my certain knowledge: I do thereupon affirm that they are not the Works of <hi>Fox, Burrow, Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> but the Quakers in general, and they are answerable for their Errors not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding each title assert the same. Thus hath Quakerism been carried on; thus hath it grown and taken its progress, by Cheats Frauds and Hypocrisies.</p>

                        <hi>4.</hi> About their Womens Meetings, and their manner and way of their Female Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Having by my Book <hi>de Christiana Liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> &amp;c. not only treated at large on this head, but also been instrumental thereby, in giving that Image a deadly blow, insomuch as that in some part of the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as well as in divers other Counties in <hi>England,</hi> there is not a distinct Womans Meeting to be seen nor heard of: But yet since 'tis mentioned in the <hi>Gen. Hist.</hi> p. 50. <q>They have likewise
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:199413:122"/> Meetings like those we call Classes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, and National Synods, or Councils. These Conventions are celebrated oftner or seldomer as the number of their Churches is, but so as to allot each Sex, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, their distinct and particular Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> I say, since the Relation of their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meetings are here brought to light, which many think are so dead and dying as that it's hard to find one in many places, and that by way of commendation as I take it, I shall therefore briefly touch upon the principal Heads, and Orders, both of its novel, rise, and arbitrary Government; and chiefly for this reason, because in all the Orders there is not so much as one Scripture proof mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confirm and to strengthen the same, even like <hi>William Smith</hi>'s Primmer and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism, which contain more than a 100 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; yet, in all the Treatise there is not one verse of Scripture quoted, nor that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one exhortation to read the Scriptures in their Family; and in his Works in Folio do I find very few Scripures quoted, if any, and them that are quoted much perverted and abused; but to the matter. Of Womens Meetings see an abstract of a Letter from <hi>G.F.</hi> who was the first mover and setter of them up, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>This new order of <hi>George Fox</hi>'s for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens distinct Meetings being ratify'd, and in all Points confirm'd, and special orders (from above) given for the strict observation of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:199413:124"/> them. There was then but few that in plain words did care to oppose them, notwitstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their was not a word of Scripture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Fox</hi> nor their yearly Meeting offer'd to prove their proceedings Apostolical, nor to warrant their Precept, nor to shew a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident since the days of Christ, or before, that Women should hold a Court or Synod distinct by themselves, have a Clark, a Book, a Purse, and the management of Church Government once a Month, to meet in the County Town about the tenth hour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Order and Institution of <hi>George Fox:</hi> And notwithstanding there was no Scripture Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident nor Divine Authority to confirm this Order of <hi>George Fox:</hi> Yet you see by this Anniversary Synod, it was ordained, enacted, and decreed, by, and with the Assent of the Delegates and Representatives; that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver discountenanced them directly or indire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, was <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be declared excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, out of the unity of their Church. I might enlarge, and shew the Decree which went forth from their Anniversary Synod 1677. Signed with 66 Names of the <hi>Foxonian</hi> Quakers; condemning <hi>John Story,</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and their Party for refusing subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Decree above mentioned; as likewise another Letter from the <hi>Storian</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers out of the North, signed by 67 Quakers disdaining and utterly condemning the <hi>Foxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Quakers, and their Pride and Arrogancy, who look upon them not only to make Laws
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:199413:124"/> unscriptural, but when done to condemn such as did not obey them, and over whom they had no power; but I rather refer to a Book stiled a Testimony against the 66 Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>W.

                     <p>I shall only add a Prophesy delivered in the Name of the Lord, in a Letter to <hi>John Story,</hi> one of the opposers of the Womens Meetings before several Witnesses the first of the first Month 1677. <hi>viz.</hi>

                              <p>Oh <hi>John Story!</hi> what hast thou done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord and thy own Soul? Thou hast divided the Heritage of the Lord, and the good Ordinances which Christ Jesus hath set up in his Church, hast thou contemned, especially Womens Preaching, and Womens Meetings; therefore the Lord will throw contempt upon thee; and if thou dost not repent speedily, miserable will be thy end. Oh how hast thou lost thy Place and Dignity which thou had'st among the Saints in Light? and now to be numbered amongst the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious: If ever thou findest Mercy with the Lord, go home to the North with speed, and break up the divided Meetings which thou and <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> has been Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to divide from the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Anger of the Lord is chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly against thee; and thou art bound with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:199413:125"/> two bonds, for the Church and Brethren have bound thee on Earth, and thou art surely bound in Heaven; and this is the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Jesus to thee; neither shalt thou be able to get from under these bonds, till thou art reconciled to the Brethren [<hi>i. e.</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>G.

                     <p>I have recited the more of this Letter of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> for that it shews, 1. That the Quakers believe that Womens Meetings are the Ordinances of Jesus Christ. 2. That they pretend to have power to bind and loose. 3. That the only way to find Mercy was to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>George Fox,</hi> and consequently to obey and observe his Laws. 4. That this false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy, delivered in the Name of the Lord, might be from Age to Age continued upon the Quakers, as a brand upon their pretence
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:199413:125"/> to Prophesy; for when the said <hi>Solomon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered this Message by Letter to <hi>John Story,</hi> the said <hi>John</hi> was very ill, and not like to live; yet it pleased God for the honour of his Name, and that these false pretenders might be manifest, to give him length of days about 4 years after. 5. That they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>George Fox</hi> the great Apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ from the First Instance. 'tis no marvel then that the Quakers have thrown off and rejected the Ordinances of Baptisme and the Lord's Supper, Instituted by Christ himself; since <hi>Fox</hi> their Apostle have ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Womens Meetings. From the 2d. That they are one with the Pope, touching the power of the Church. From the 3d. That the Merits and Satisfaction of Christ, as our Mediator and Intercessor, of his Death and bitter Passion, are by the Quakers laid aside, if the only way to find Mercy with God, be to be reconcil'd to the Quaker Church. From the 4th. That the Quakers are not zealous for God by their cloaking and excusing this false Prophesy of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> as well as divers others of his Idolatrous Practices; and by their owning him and his Books to the last, and never passing a publick censure upon him and his Books. From the 5th. That 'tis no marvel that they are so much concern'd to vindicate every little Pamphlet of their own with great charge and industry; but when the Papists call our Bible a brazen Fac'd, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and false Bible; this they say in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:199413:126"/> words, they are not concern'd to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, this they leave to the Sectarian and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopalians to do; for alas they have work enough besides; and as to the Bible, though the Papists call it a <hi>brazen Fac'd Book false and corrupt,</hi> yet the Quakers are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to vindicate the Bible; and indeed how can they against the Papists, for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists would soon reply, what do the Quakers blame us for calling your Bible a brazen Fac'd Book, whil'st you your selves call it Death, Dust, Beastly Wares, Serpents Food? How then can you blame us, since we are Cousin Jermains, and Dear Brethren in the common cause against the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Good God, when I consider their deep Hypocrisy in their confession to the Parliament, I am astonish'd at their impudence, and so I proceed to the next Head.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <hi>5.</hi> Moreover, saith the Historian p. <hi>55.</hi> it's also their custome in their Houses, never to express a Religious Duty with an outward Voice, as praying to God, craving his Blessing e'er they take Meat, or go to Bed, till they feel the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>This also is the fruit of Quakerism; read one of their Books stiled <hi>A Musick Lecture,</hi> &amp;c. p. 25. <q>For where they [<hi>i. e.</hi> Christians] are, I was in Performances, in Ordinances, in Family Duties, in Hearing, in Reading, in Prayers, in Fastings; well, but when I came to bend my Mind to that of God in me, which <hi>is Christ,</hi> then I begun to learn to be a Fool,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:199413:126"/> insomuch, that I durst not give God thanks for the Victuals that were set before me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reader, this their practice is so well known in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in <hi>Holland,</hi> that I need not to enlarge upon it; only take up a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation when I consider how many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Families of Quakers there are in <hi>England,</hi> that never prayed to God in their Houses, nor gave thanks for Blessings received with outward Voice, since they turned Quakers, perhaps 20 or 30 years: What account then will they be able to give at the great and terrible Day? Who have thus bewitched the People from the practice of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, Saints and Martyrs, and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches to this day, unto the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Heathen that know no God, read Jeremiah 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen, and upon the families that call not on thy name!</hi> But, possibly they'll say, they think of God when they go to Bed, and when they receive the Comforts of this Life; to which I answer; if that be enough, and that words are useless, why then do their Teachers speak and pray in their Meetings with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Voice, and sometimes at your own Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses when People are there? Is this their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice only that they may be seen of Men? a thing I am jealous of; for if they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it their Duty, why not a Duty incumbent upon the hearers also? But they say in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>'s Works p. 47. That is no command of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:199413:127"/> God to thee, which God commanded to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, unless they receive it a new as the Inspired Apostles did. Thus have they taken away they Key of Knowledge from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I mean the use of the Holy Scripture, which would instruct them better: Nay, this is not all, but where the Spirit of Quakerism is in its full vigor; if they happen to be in company with a Man of another Profession, whether Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, or Baptist, who crave a Blessing upon what they receive, ☞ sits the Quaker with his Hat on, as a Testimony against that lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Practice.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <hi>6.</hi> They have Anniversary Synods in every consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Kingdom, to whom belong the Care and Administration of all the Affairs of that Kingdom. In <hi>England</hi> they have a fixed Anniversary Synod on the third day of Penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost. Gen. Hist. p. <hi>51.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be true, but of how dangerous a consequence both to Church and State I am not able to determine, but time will further manifest: But the more they encrease and gain upon their People, and believe that they are the only true Church, and as such, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err; that they have power to bind and loose; and that their Precepts and Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are of equal Authority to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and thereupon ought to be indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly obeyed; I say, as this comes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and embraced, the danger of these Anniversary Synods will be seen more and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:199413:127"/> more, and it may be when 'tis too late; for they not only already think themselves capable to teach Judges, Justices, yea, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament too. What is their Duty, what they may do, and what they may not do, and the utmost confines of their Jurisdiction? parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the case of Heresy, of which I have recited some Instances, and can hundreds more; as also by two of their Anniversary Synods they have virtually, tho' not verbally, repealed great part of two Statute Laws that of the 22 of <hi>C.</hi> II. and that clause of an Act of Parliament made in the First of K. <hi>W.</hi> III. relating to Tythes by their yearly Epistles, enregistred by Authority of their Anniversary Synods; I need not here relate what an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence their first Epistle had, and how little the Law was regarded or observed the whole Nation is witness; and as to the last about Tythes and Church-warden Rates, which the Parliament took care to preserve in their old Channel, in the same Law which indulge the Quakers in the exercise of their perswasion; yet this very Law they <hi>Anno</hi> 1696. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged implicitly with Antichristianism, saying, p. 1. <q>That all due care be taken against that grand Oppression, and Antichristian Yoke of Tythes; that our Christian Testimony born and greatly suffered for, be faithfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against them, in all respects, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Steeple-house-rates, or Lays; as also against the burthen and imposition of Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Here we see Tythes are Antichristian,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:199413:128"/> and their Testimony Christian; a perfect Map of their whole Doctrine; the Parliament An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, the Quakers Christian; the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament great Oppressors, the Quakers Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, tho' they pay no more than their Neighbours; the Parliament lay Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Yokes upon the Quakers, the Quakers the only Christian sufferers, and persecuted Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; whose sufferings and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are greater and more unjust, than the sufferings of Christ, his Apostles and Martyrs; for what was inflicted upon them, was duly executed by a Law; and to this practice of ours agree that Doctrine of St. <hi>Edw. Burrow</hi>'s, as it is written in our Gospel, in the Book of our Holy Scriptures, which we at all times stand ready to vindicate; vulgarly call'd <hi>Ed. Burrow</hi>'s Works p. 501. <q>Witnesses we stand against Parliaments, Councels, Judges, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, who make and execute Laws in their own wills over the Consciences of Men; and to such Laws, Customs, Courts, or Arbitrary Usurped Dominion we cannot yield obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> And therefore by this our Anniversary Decree, we Ordain and Enact, that the Members of all our Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, and all other our Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates in every Kingdom, Nation and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that adhere to us, and believe us to be the universal Church of the First born, who cannot err, but are led by an infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that all and every of our Disciples throw off all these Antichristian Yokes of grand Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:199413:128"/> and from henceforth stand faithful Witnesses against Tythes as Antichristian, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Church Rates, against lawful Oathes, against carrying Guns; and this, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian says, is to go through <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> yea all the World over; and all that suffer for their Stubborness and Antimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratical Principles, by the same Edict is to be taken into Record, who it is that suffer, for what cause they suffer, and on what account. I have not time to set forth the dangerous consequences of these Anniversary Synods, when they once gain upon the People that they are the only universal Catholick Church, and as such cannot err; that as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> Teaches, the People are to believe as she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves: I say, on this Doctrine of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hangs a load of dangers; the Parliament say one thing, the Anniversary Synod at <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire-house</hi> another; they now argue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, but in time may dispute the Point publickly: Infallibility sticks at nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be for the Holy Church in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists Dialect, or for Truth's sake in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: They are Terms Synonymous, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their Authors, and <hi>W. Penn</hi> s Books ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted declare plainly how vigorous he was for his near Friends and dear kindred in the late Reign; and the Quakers addressed from their Anniversary Synods run in the same Channel, and flow from the same Fountain, for K. <hi>J.</hi> II. and against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there came forth publick Addresses Annually, besides
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:199413:129"/> Books every Month in favour of the then Government and against the Church: But since King <hi>William</hi> came to the Crown, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a publick Anniversary Address to King <hi>W.</hi> nor one Book wrot in favour of the present Governments, as anon will appear. And thus Quakerism, like the Snake in the Grass, creeps on undiscovered, or at least little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken how she secretly Smites, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Stings, and throws out her Poyson both at Church and State; She'll Arraign, Impeach, Try, Judge, Summons, Dialogue, Condemn both Magistrate and Minister, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and People; yet if she be but toucht; Oh how she winches and giffles up and down! crying she's wrong'd, she's abus'd, and all is malice that's said of her; whil'st she takes the liberty to abuse, traduce, stigmatize and calumniate all other People. This is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of this clamorous Woman; and tho' I do solemnly profess, as in the sight of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, I am not for Persecution, neither do I desire, nor none need to fear that our King and Parliament should follow the French King's example in what is of the nature of Persecution or Cruelty; yet on the other hand, when they perceive the Ingratitude of this insolent People, they probably may take some measures to stop the Stream of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie which spreads like a Leprosie through the Nation: And forasmuch as something that is praise worthy on the French King's part, in granting the Ministry of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:199413:129"/> Churches leave to hold a national Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and for the exemplariness of the French Protestants zeal for God, care of his Church, subjection to the Laws according to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Doctrine of Christ, his Apostles and Martyrs. I shall set down a few things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy observation, from the 28 Synod held at <hi>Charenton</hi> near <hi>Paris</hi> the 26 day of <hi>December</hi> 1644. as in the 2 Vol. of <hi>John Quick</hi>'s Hist. p. 4. 28. to 437. <hi>viz.</hi>

                                 <p>And that all things may be done in that Order prescribed me by their Majesties, I am in their Names commanded to acquaint you, that all Ministers who are <hi>not Natural born Subjects</hi> but Strangers, are to be <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Synod,</hi> and that none may assist to Vote in it who hath not Letters of Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his Provincial Synod; and that during the time it be held, you may have no <hi>Communication with Forreigners</hi> or other suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Persons; and forasmuch as <hi>your Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> are not by any legal constitution a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, their Majesties have <hi>forbidden</hi> you to <hi>meddle</hi> in <hi>State Affairs</hi> or matters of Justice, because your Synod hath no power to judge of such matters; but only to treat of Points of Doctrine, and Church Discipline. Moreover their Majesties do forbid you to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:199413:131"/>
                                    <hi>print</hi> any Books in <hi>any</hi> place whatsoever, concerning your Religion, which are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested [<hi>i. e.</hi> licensed] by two manuel Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates of two Ministers at the least, under pain of confiscation of the whole Impression; nor may you denounce any <hi>excommunication</hi> against any <hi>Minister</hi> or others, who shall change their Religion for that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, nor treat them reproachfully neither by Word nor Writing. Moreover, when they speak of the <hi>Pope,</hi> they are not to call him Antichrist, nor to treat him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respectfully; nor shall they tax the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with Idolatry, nor the Sacraments, nor Ceremonies thereof as humane Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor to make Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Money.</p>

                                    <p>We thankfully acknowledge the great Goodness and Mercy of Almighty God, in answering the Prayers of his poor Churches with his heavenly Blessing, and their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties condescention in accepting our most humble Petition, presented by the Lords of our general Deputies, and granting us this privilege of holding this Synod, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the <hi>inspection</hi> of it unto a Person most Illustrious for his Vertues, and well deserving that high Place of Dignity and Honour in the first and chiefest Parliament of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: All these and many other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:199413:131"/> do enforce our Souls with a sweet and pleasing violence, to break forth into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged Praises, and enflamed Thankfulness unto their Majesties, yea, and in most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Supplications unto our God, for the preservation of their Sacred Persons, his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction upon their Government, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Crowns, under whose comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shadows the Churches enjoying a sweet Peace, will never have any other desire or thought than to practice faithfully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously, that most express command of our Lord and Saviour by his Apostle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to fear God and honour the King; and that with a most entire and sincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                                    <p>And as we have no design to do it, so we shall never admit any persons to sit as a Member of our National Synod, who hath not a Deputation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor shall we hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny correspondency with, nor receive any Letters coming from Forreigners, nor return any answers to them, unless that my Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, who represents His Majesty's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, shall have first perused them; nor will we debate about matters of State, nor <hi>make</hi> any Orders in relation to them; nor shall we set up Provincial Counsels in opposition to His Majesty's Will; nor, as His Majesty hath demanded of us, will we suffer those Canons of our National Synods, concerning the approbation of Books, that shall be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on matters of Religion to be violated
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:199413:132"/> nor shall we excommunicate any of those Persons who quit the Communion of our Churches, for we do not arrogate to our selves any Jurisdiction over them, from that minute in which they left us; nor shall we tollerate any Sermons fraught with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and reproachful Language against the Members of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor suffer that Monies be collected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Thus Reader you see, the Protestants ask and the King grants; the King limits them, sets them bounds; the Protestants promise to obey. 1. Not to admit Strangers to sit in their Synods. 2. Nor to hold corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with Forreigners. 3. Nor will they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about State matters. 4. Nor make any Orders relating to them. 5. Nor print Books unlicens'd. 6. Nor excommunicate Persons that quit their Society; for they do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to themselves such a power, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves the only true Church in the World, like the old Strumpet and the young Harlot. 7. Nor will they tollerate any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons [or Books] fraught with injurious and reproachful Language; nor will they suffer <hi>Money</hi> to be collected, which as it's called the Sinew of War, so <hi>it</hi> may be called the Nerve of Heresie. I hope to such as will read this Book, and others I have wrote, will not stand in need of proof that the Quakers are guilty of all that the Christians are herein said to be thus innocent of. Having shewed the danger of the Quakers Anniversary Synods, upon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:199413:132"/> their Principle of Infallibility, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. and <hi>Tindal</hi>'s Works (i. e.) <hi>The obedience of a Christian Man,</hi> &amp;c. p. 111. '<hi>viz.</hi> For God hath made the King in every Realm Judge over all; he that resisteth the King resisteth God; if the Subjects Sin, they must be brought to the King's Judgment; if the King Sin he must be brought to the Judgment of God, and as it is to resist the King, so it is to resist his Officers, which are sent to execute the King's Commandment; for it is written, let every Soul be subject to the higher Power; here is no Man exempt, but all Souls must obey; and so I proceed to the next Head.</p>

                        <hi>London,</hi> April, 1687. <q>We pray God to bless the King, His Royal Family and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Grace and Peace; and that after a long and prosperous Reign here, he may receive a better Crown amongst the Blessed: Which is the Prayer of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Scotland,</hi> June, 1687. <q>We cannot but with grateful Hearts both admire and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Providence of God that made the Kings retiring into our Country (i. e. <hi>Scotland,</hi> 1679) give a happy turn to his Affairs, to the defeating and disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the designs of his Enemies. — We do justly conceive our selves obliged, by a special tye, to praise God for his Goodness, in carrying the King thorow, and over all his troubles, since by the same Providence, and at the same time, by which the Lord began in that more observable manner, to evidence his care of him, he made him the happy Instrument to deliver us from our troubles. So that the prosperity of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and our peaceable fruition of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of our Consciences beareth the same date the 3d. <hi>London, August</hi> 1678.

                     <p>Mark Reader, here is Address upon Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, and Prayer after Prayer for the late King <hi>James</hi> II. which sound his Fame from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence Eccoed back from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> in the highest strain, and most elegant Stile the Quakers could invent, sutable to their singular Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. I do not mention this practice whil'st he was King of <hi>England,</hi> and seated on the Throne as an Evil in it self, or inconsistent with their Duty, and the Duty of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; for 'tis my Judgment that we ought to pray for <hi>all Kings</hi> which God in his Providence sets over us, without disputing their Titles; and to obey every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's sake, knowing that there is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, and who so resist the Powers, they resist the Ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation according to these Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 <hi>cap. Mat.</hi> 22.21. I say I do not recite these Addresses and Prayers made by the Quakers to, and for the late King, as an Evil in it self, for I do believe we ought to pray for all Kings, whether they be <hi>Pagan</hi> or Christian, Papist or Protestant, good or bad, Orthodox, or Hetrodox, Protectors or Persecutors, for such was the practice of all Gods faithful Saints and Servants, from <hi>Abraham</hi> downwards to this day, as these

Hist.</hi> my self and thousands more is, that they should thus heartily pray for, and address themselves unto the late King, and write so many Books in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, calling him brave King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God and <hi>Cesar</hi> are both of a mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A sensible Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in God's hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and notwithstanding all this and much more that might be said on the same Subject, yet when King <hi>William,</hi> his present Majesty, whom God preserve, came to the Crown, and the very first Year of His Reign, did, by Law indulge them in the exercise of their perswasion, and give them all the ease they reasonably could desire, yet they made not one Address to him, nor one Prayer for him, as they did for the late King; no, nor yet wrot one Book in favour of the Government, which made me and others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at their ingratitude; for, I was so far of the same mind with the Author of the <hi>Gen. Hist.</hi> That I thought the Quakers could not but love K. <hi>W.</hi> III. and embrace him as their most effectual Defender; but when I came to prove them, and try them, and measure them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:199413:134"/> by their Fruits, and to consider that in two years space they made 4 Addresses to the late K. <hi>J.</hi> II. and that in 4 years time they had not made one Address to K. <hi>W.</hi> III. I then altered my mind, and by reading of their said Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, and their Books wrot by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> I found that the stream of their Affections did run like a mighty torrent to the late K. <hi>J.</hi> II. when there was not the least issuing drop of Affection run to His present Majesty; and this put me upon writing a Letter to the Quakers, <hi>August</hi> 1690. p. 2. <q>Now if you would be constant; then, why do you not pray for, and address your selves to K. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> as heartily, and as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly as you did to, and for, K. <hi>J.</hi> whom you call'd and said, <hi>a Brave King, God</hi> and <hi>Cesar</hi> are <hi>both</hi> of <hi>a mind pray Godbless the King and His Royal Family.</hi> These and many more [magnifying Expressions] were published thro the Nations: But no Salutation, no Message, no Prayer for, nor no Address to K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> as if you were struck mute at the loss of your brave King, whom you said was of the same mind with God: What can you say for your selves? Are you like those 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. <hi>viz.</hi> The Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> who said, how shall this Man save us? And they despised him, and they brought him no presents [no Addresses nor Prayers] but the King held his peace. Oh you unworthy and ungrateful Persons! Hath not King <hi>William</hi> granted you the Liberty of your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:199413:135"/> and confirmed it by a Law? What, have you nothing to say for King <hi>William?</hi> Nay, you are so far from that, that when His Majesty appointed a Fast, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of his Armies, you not only Preached against the Fast, but also, to weaken the Hearts and Hands of his Friends, you did vehemently cry down all Wars and Fighting. Is your zeal for the Protestant cause, and the Protestant interest quite lost and gone, or is it gone to <hi>Rome?</hi> You have had several yearly Meetings since this King's Reign, but not the least publick acknowledgment of the special Favour shewed you by the King and Parliament; I will not say but some of your People may be heartily thankful, yet it plainly appears, that your Leaders and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers [and Anniversary Synods] are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind; for had you been as hearty and zealous for the present Government, as in point of gratitude you should and ought to have been, your People had not been so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and so confused touching the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant interest, as now they are; the sad and evil Effects of which must, and will be laid at your doors. Consider what is said, repent and amend your ways, for this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the Protestant Interest are so link d together, that those who are not true to the one cannot be true to the other, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their pretences are, or may be.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I wrot, and caused it to be printed and dispersed as a Testimony against their luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmness
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199413:135"/> to the present Government, and their Zeal to, and for the late Reign as this Section, and Sections 5 6 do make plainly appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But possibly some may object, that these are private Addresses by some few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and be ready to demand, whether they ever made a publick Anniversary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, that thereby they might, in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, shew their Loyalty to the late King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The humble Address of the People call'd Quakers, from their yearly Meeting, the <hi>6th.</hi> of the Month called <hi>June, 1688. viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>We the Kings peaceable Subjects, from divers parts of his Dominions, being met together in this City, after our usual manner to inspect the affairs of our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Society <hi>throughout the World,</hi> think it our Duty humbly to represent to him the <hi>blessed</hi> Effects, the Liberty he has graciously granted his People to worship God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Consciences, hath had both on our Persons and Estates; for whereas we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had long and sorrowful Lists brought to us, from almost all parts of his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:199413:136"/> of Prisoners and the spoil of Goods by violent and ill Men, upon account of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. We bless God, and thank the King, the Goals are every where clear, except in cases of <hi>Tythes,</hi> and the repairs of Parish Churches, and some few about Oaths; and we do in all Humility lay it before the King to consider the hardships our Friends are yet under for Conscience sake, in those respects, being in the one chiefly expos'd to the present Anger of the offended Clergy, who have therefore imprisoned some of them till death, and in the other they are rendered very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to the publick and themselves; for both in reference to Freedoms in Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Probats of Wills and Testaments, and Administrations, Answers in Chancery and Exchequer, Tryals of our just Titles and Debts, proceeding in our Trades in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome house, serving the Office of Constables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are disabled and great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges taken against them; unless the King's Favour do interpose; and as we humbly hope he may relieve us, so we confidently assure our selves he will ease us what he can.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Now since it hath pleased thee, O King, to renew to all thy Subjects by thy last De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, thy gracious Assurances to pursue the Establishment of this Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, upon an unalterable Foundation; and in order to it to hold a Parliament in <hi>Nov.</hi> next at farthest; we think our selves deeply engaged to renew our assurances of Fidelity
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:199413:136"/> and Affection, and with God's help, intend to do our part for the effecting so blessed and glorious a Work; that so it may be out of the power of any one party to hurt another upon the account of Conscience: And as we firmly believe that God will never desert this righteous cause of Liberty, nor the King in maintaining of it; so we hope by God's Grace to let the World see, we can honestly and heartily appear for Liberty of Conscience, and be inviolably true to our own Religion, whatever the Folly or Madness of some Men on that account may suggest to the contrary.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are the sayings of their Anniversary Synod. Here you see is nothing wanting but bended knees; here is in <hi>all</hi> Humility, in <hi>all</hi> Fidelity, with <hi>all</hi> Affection, yea, <hi>all, all, all, all</hi> Prayers for him; for long Life, for a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reign, Laud and Praise in the highest; for his Deliverance, for the defeating his Enemies [the excluders,] yea, it would be too long to enumerate them: Besides, Book af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Book in favour of the Government; and Letter after Letter printed and dispersed; a first, a second and a third for the repealing the Penal Laws and Tests, that so the Papists might sit in Parliament to Establish them a new Order, even St. <hi>George</hi>'s Order as compleatly as their Grandfather <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> had his Order confirmed by the Popes Bulls, <hi>October</hi> 3d. <hi>Anno</hi> 1540 as at large set forth in a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning the Idolatry of the Church of Rome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 281. But God in his righteous
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:199413:137"/> Judgment deserted their King, their Cause; and will in time more fully discover their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be of the same tendency, and carried on by the same Holy cheats, that <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi>'s Order of the Jesuits was. And so much brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to shew how Quakerism grew, and after what manner it made its progress; and how they bent their strength against the Protestant Interest, Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Religion.</p>
                     <p>But Reader, did you ever hear of an Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Address to King <hi>William?</hi> No such matter: Did you ever see a Book put forth in favour of the present Government? No such matter; no, no, 'tis as in my printed Letter 1690. above recited. <hi>No</hi> Salutation, <hi>no</hi> Message, <hi>no</hi> Prayer for, nor <hi>no</hi> Address to, King <hi>William</hi> III from this their yearly Synod, nor a Book wrot in favour of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>no,</hi> in all Humility, <hi>no,</hi> in all Affection, <hi>no</hi> publick Prayers for his long and prosperous Reign, <hi>no</hi> Laud and Praise that his Enemies are defeated; here is <hi>no, no, no, no.</hi> Come <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and foreman of your Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Synod; what can you say for your selves? Why are you mute? Why have you not brought forth one publick Anniversary Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Address this seven years? nor publick Prayers; or, are you still like those we read on, 1 Sam. 10.27. <hi>But the children of Beliel said, how shall this man save us? and they despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, and brought him no presents</hi> [no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, no Addresses] <hi>but the King held his peace.</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:199413:137"/> But, that I may not leave out one cluster of the Quakers Vine by which Quakerism has been nourished, I shall now mention a notable passage, to discover the Quakers aversion to the present Government, <hi>viz.</hi> The Widow <hi>Whitrow,</hi> formerly a Quaker, wrot a Book in favour of the Government about four years since, but it did so cross the Quakers current, that they made an Order for the calling it in, and suppressing the same; the which I have, together with their not addressing His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesty, more largely handled in my Book <hi>New Rome unmask'd</hi> p. 26. to 32.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> Well, but may some say, tho' it be granted that since His Majesty King <hi>William</hi> came to the Crown, the Quakers have made no publick address to him, tho' it was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with them so to do to the late King, which we must acknowledge do shew of what stamp they are; yet <hi>Anno</hi> 95. they gave out a Paper they stil'd <hi>Their Ancient Testimony renewed, with respect to the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and touching the present Association;</hi> where they have these words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>And we believe that the timely discovery and prevention of the late barbarous Design, and Mischievous Plot against the King and Government, and the sad Effects it might have had, is an eminent Mercy from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; for which we, and the whole Nation have great cause to be humbly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and to pray for the continuance of his Mercies to them and us. From a Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:199413:138"/> of the said People in <hi>London,</hi> the 23d. of the first Month called <hi>March</hi> 1695/6.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The recited Paper was given into the Lords House, where their Bill for their Affirmation, to pass instead of an Oath, was under the Lords consideration, it having passed the House of Commons, and I being there, ask'd one of the Clarks to give me one of the said Papers, which having perused, I saw clearly their Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles: For, first it was not signed by any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, neither had they once mentioned what King they meant; and I knowing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and cunning way of insinuating, and yet to leave a back door to creep out at on occasion, I wrot a Reply to their Paper, which is as followeth, somewhat contracted, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           <p>YOur Paper is not signed, and thereby seems fallacious from the top to the bottom; for what credit can be given to a Paper not signed, only said to be given out at a Meeting in <hi>London;</hi> the King's Proclamations are

                     <p>This Reply I presented to the Lords on the 28th of <hi>March</hi> 1696. which was very well accepted of; and soon after one of the Peers came out and said to this effect: Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> this Paper of yours will not do, you must be plain, and declare what King you mean, and also sign your Paper; and if you do so, and appear plain and sincere, I will do the best I can for you, and possibly your Bill may pass the House, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this did so startle the Quakers, and made them so angry with <hi>Fra. Bugg,</hi> that <hi>Gilbert Laytey</hi> could not contain himself, but before several Lords and other Gentlemen, abused me to my Face; as also, <hi>Jacob Franklin</hi> and some others, to whom I reply'd what was needfull at that time, in my own defence, and to the great satisfaction of the Lords and other Gentlemen present. But, this was not all, but by and by came out a Bishop of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and said, Mr. <hi>Whitehead,</hi> we have considered of your Bill, but we shall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:199413:140"/> insert a clause for the payment of Tythes; and a power, in case of neglect of payment, to distrain for any summ not exceeding 10 <hi>l.</hi> what think you of that? If you will not accept of it so, it will be thrown out.

                        <hi>viz.</hi> What hard things are now upon us poor innocent Quakers? that our Papers will not pass without signing, nor will our meaning pass, but we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in plain words what King we mean; this does indeed pinch us, and sorely trouble us; and, which is still as bad, we must have a clause put in to bind us to pay Tythes, and this will go down but ruggedly with the Friends: What shall I say, or how shall I come off? If I accept of it on these Terms I shall displease many; if I loose the Bill, and with it our Money spent to obtain it [tho' when all is done, 'tis no less, nor more an Oath then I took my self in the Lord Mayor's Court, upon a Bill exhibited against me by <hi>Thomas Daniel</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wise, <hi>April</hi> 9th 1695.] I shall displease others; what shall I do? I am beset round on every side; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are fears, within are doubts; one sort of Friends will blame me for accepting of it; thus <hi>I</hi> A.

                     </p>
                     <p>Reader, this is the case, their first Paper dated <hi>March</hi> 3 1695/6 not signed, nor King <hi>W.</hi> named, was thrown out, and poor <hi>G. W.</hi> and his Associates signed another dated the 3d day of <hi>April</hi> 1696. A Copy thereof a Person of Quality sent me, which Paper was signed, and the King's Name at large in it; that part of it which answers to the other part already recited I will set down, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>And we believe that the timely discovery and prevention of the late barbarous Design and mischievous Plot against <hi>King William</hi> and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the sad Effects it might have had is an eminent Mercy from Almighty God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <hi>At a Meeting of the said People</hi> the 3d of April 96. <hi>Signed</hi> by <hi>many</hi> of <hi>us</hi> on behalf of our selves, and the <hi>rest</hi> of our Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note Reader, that this Paper presented to the King <hi>April</hi> 8. 1696. dated <hi>April</hi> 3. 96. was never dispersed among the Quakers, but kept private: But that Paper dated <hi>March</hi> 3. 1695/6. wherein the King is not named, and which therefore the Lords threw out; that Paper was dispersed far and near; so the poor Quakers still may be to seek what King their Teachers mean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reader, I have already put down the Form of the Quakers Oath, I <hi>A. B.</hi> &amp;c. I shall now
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:199413:141"/> add another clause in the said Act, which will prevent them from coming into any share of the Government, which they have long wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for; but thanks be to God Quakerism has by this Act got such a blow, as they will not easily rub off, viz.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Provided and be it Enacted, that no Quaker, or reputed Quaker shall by vertue of this Act be qualify'd or permitted to give evidence in any Criminal Causes; to serve on any Juries, or bear any Office or place of [Trust] or Profit in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; any thing in this Act contained to the contrary, in any wise notwithstanding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And having thus far shewed Mr. <hi>Croese</hi> his mistake of the Quakers loving King <hi>William</hi> as their effectual Defender, as well as in some other things in his General History: I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout leaving him until the next opportunity, hoping when he considers and sees how Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerism first rose, and how it has grown, and by what means and methods it has had its progress, that he will not blame me for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling plainly with them, especially when he sees and considers the scurrilous Names and ignominious Terms they have cast upon the Learned Clergy of this <hi>British</hi> Nation, as Robbers, Thieves, Witches, Devils, Antichrists, Bloodhounds, the Sir <hi>Simons</hi> of the Age, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests, Sodomites, and what not, which might render them and their function odious to the People; as also their Pamphlets to the Parliaments to leave and forsake them;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:199413:141"/> and so I take my leave of this learned Historian and bid him farewel.</p>
                     <p>By this time some may say, you seem to know the distemper of this corrupted Body of Quakerism; pray let us know a Remedy to stop the gangreen; for many wise and learned Men have endeavoured to apply a Remedy, but have hitherto missed; yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Corrasives which have been too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to stop the running thereof; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Lenetives which have taken no place at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> I do acknowledge, and experience teacheth us, that sometimes tho ablest Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian for want of knowing the Disease has missed, when one not so noted, has with the help of Herbs, and what is common, wrought a Cure. First then, the most proper way to Cure this Distemper which lies in the Brain, and affects the Heart also, is to let <hi>George W.</hi> and some few of the most eminent Teachers and Writers amongst the Quakers, be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by Authority, and by the same exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, whether these Books quoted as theirs, be really so or no. Next, if proved upon them, let them either justifie or retract them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, after this is done, let them set forth certain Articles of their Faith, and if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Christian Religion, then let them condemn all their Books which teach the contrary: This was the way of the French Protestants; and when so done, let each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Quakers have their Teacher, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:199413:142"/> each Teacher have their Congregation, and take care of the same, that so the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Youth be not corrupted and poysoned by sucking in false Notions, and imbibing false Principles in their young years: This is what pleases all Protestant Dissenters, both Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Independants, and Baptists and for which they are very thankful to the Government, and in their Meetings pray heartily for the preservation thereof, as I have heard in all their Societies. And if nothing less then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary Synods, and General Councels will please these aspiring Quakers; before they have them, let them ask leave of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to hold them, and how long to continue the sitting thereof; and if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment think good to bestow that Favour of them, it would be very proper that there should be a Commissioner or two, Ordered and Commissioned by His Majesty to reside in their Councel, the doors being open, and free ingress for their Deputies, and liberty for them to speak freely; and their Acts put into Writing for preventing confusion; and when this is done, it will be proper to limit and set them bounds (who of themselves are boundless) and to restrain them from these things following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That all their Ministers who are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural born Subjects, but Foreigners, [whose coming may be to spy out the weaknesses of our Country, to alienate the King's Subjects from their obedience to their Sovereign]
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:199413:142"/> may be excluded out of their Synod, and have neither place nor voice in their general Counsel.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that during the time granted them by Authority to hold their Synod, they may have no communication with Forreigners, or other suspected Persons, as Jesuits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. And forasmuch as the Quakers are not by any legal constitution a body Politick; therefore they should not meddle in State Affairs, <hi>viz.</hi> to condemn Acts of Parliaments as Antichristian and Oppressive to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and thereby absolve their Disciples from their obedience to their Lawful Magistrates, whom they ought to obey as the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, set over them by God, entrusted with the supreme Authority, and their part is to yield a dutiful subjection and faithful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as whereunto they stand oblig'd by the commands of Christ and his Apostles, and the practice of God's faithful Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, holy Apostles and Martyrs in all Ages, by their Birth as natural born Subjects of these Realms; by the dictates of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and the many Favours they daily receive in being defended and protected in their Liberty and Property, and by all kinds of consideration both general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That they print no Books but what are licens'd by Commissioners, appointed by His Majesty for that purpose, under pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the whole impression; this would be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:199413:143"/> a great means to restore <hi>England</hi> to its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Glory, which once it had, when it was famous for extirpating Heresie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of latter years 'tis reported by the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian of the Quakers History, to be a Nurse for Heresie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That they do not arrogate to themselves the power of excommunicating such as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from them, and conform themselves to the Establish'd Religion, nor treat them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully, but that they study to be quiet and mind their own business.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That they be not permitted in their Books and Sermons to call legal Punishments Persecution; calling the Magistrates Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, thereby rendering them odious to the common People.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That they be not permitted in these Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods to approve of such Books, nor to teach such Doctrine as call the national Ministry Witches, Devils, Antichrists; nor the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, Judges, Justices, and other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, the Beasts that carry the Whore, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of the Saints, nor to impeach their judicial Proceedings.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That they be not permitted to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Try, Judge, Arraign, Condemn, and Dyalogue the national Ministry, Magistracy and People, and thereby lift up and extol themselves, as the only Catholick Universal Church of the First-born, which cannot err; and Curse, Damn, and Reprobate all other Christians. This has been their frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:199413:143"/> and a main Pillar of their Heresie; for, when they gain upon the common People, that the Apostolick Order of the Church of Christ is re-establish'd only amongst them; and that all other Societies are Apostates, Antichrists, Heathens, and Infidels, they then have gained the point, and will soon claim the Chair, and reach at the Scepter.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That they be forbidden to make Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Tax the People, and lay by Funds as their manner is; for, as Money is said to be the Sinews of War, so may it be call'd the Nerve of Heresie; but let each Society of Quakers maintain their own Teacher, and not have a common Bank at <hi>London</hi> and Feoffees entrusted therewith to give 8 10 or 20 <hi>l.</hi> at a time to their Travelling Teachers, who range all the World over, bantering all other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters who have a settled maintenance, and are far less chargeable to their Hearers than are the Quakers Teachers, who come uncall'd for, like Flies and Mice eat up the provision of others, as saith the Historian.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. That they be not permitted to call the Scriptures of the Prophets, Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, by those contemptible Names of Death, Dust, Beastly-Ware, Serpents-Food, and the like.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But that they be compell'd to condemn those Books of theirs which so teach; for, thus do they bring the Christian Religion into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, in order to raise Quakerism as the most excellent of all Religions.</p>

                     <p>From our Yearly Meeting in <hi>London 27</hi> of 3d Month <hi>1675.</hi> To all our Quarterly and Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Concerning Mens and Womens Meetings, it is our Judgment and Testimony in the Word of God's Wisdom, that the rise and practice, setting up and establishing of Mens and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meetings in the Churches of Christ in this our Day and Generation, is according to the Mind and Counsel of God, and done in the ordering and leading of his Eternal Spirit— And it is our Sense, Advice, Admonition and Judgment in the fear of God, and in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Power and Spirit to Friends and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:199413:145"/> Brethren in their several Meetings, that no such <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> Names and Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as calling Mens and Womens Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Courts Sessions,</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> that they are Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Impositions, useless and burdensome; that faithful Friends Papers which <hi>we</hi> Testify, have been given forth by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, are Mens <hi>Edicts</hi> or <hi>Cannons,</hi> Elders in the Service of the Church, <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> with such <hi>scornful</hi> sayings, be permitted among them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Behold what Names and Expressions are contained in the recited 12 particulars, given by themselves to the Scripture, Bishops and Clergy, Ministry and People; yet, none must say why do they so, but it must be accounted malicious; and yet, how tender are these Men of their own blasphemous Books and defamato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Libels; insomuch, that as I am willing to note some things from the French King, <hi>so</hi> would I have some observe the Quakers me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in this matter for their example, and not suffer the Holy Scripture, the Book of Common Prayer, the Christian Magistracy, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry to be thus contemned, vilifyed, and set at naught by this irreligious spawn of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits; and so I conclude this matter, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe my Name.</p>

                  <p>My Author, the Historian, is now so far besides the matter, and gives a Relation so contrary to their practice, that He and I must part again; for I may not keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him at present, but I must shew him his mistakes. 1st. In general, They Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons all Archbishops, Lordbishops, Deans, Prebends, Doctors, Vicars, Curates, and all Prelaticals, as this Book sets forth at large, not personally but ficttiously; and when this is done, they Arraign, Try, and Judge them unheard, to be Monsters, Witches, Devils, Antichrists, Bloodhounds, Conjurers, and false Prophets; but to come closer to matter of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> Particularly about the Year 1676. A difference happen'd between me and <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> and one of their Speakers touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fine of 15 <hi>l.</hi> which I suffered for him, for that his Name and Habitation was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Justices so as to levy a Fine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Goods and Chattels; and in regard I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:199413:146"/> thought it but reasonable, that he should make me restitution; and also finding by their Books that in the loss of 13550 <hi>l.</hi> by Fines and Distresses, by an Act of Parliament made the 22 of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. Entituled <hi>An Act to prevent and suppress seditious Conventicles,</hi> &amp;c. The Preachers, where strangers never lost 50 <hi>l.</hi> and thereupon (not barely for my own sake, but my Fellow Hearers) I prosecuted <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> for restitution of the said 15 <hi>l.</hi> suffered for him as aforesaid, in that he did not declare his Name and Habitation, when he saw the Informers convicting the Meeting, as at large set forth in my Book, <hi>The painted Harlot both Stript and Whipt,</hi> &amp;c. and that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> &amp;c. and to which I refer the Reader for further satisfaction. Yet to shew that they condemn Persons unheard, and that their judicial proceedings are Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Partial, as well as Illegal; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, like the high Court of Justice, which would not permit King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to give his Reasons, nor to be heard in his just defence, as at large in <hi>The History of Independancy,</hi> &amp;c. I shall transcribe some passages of that Transaction, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1676. I went to the Yearly Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>London,</hi> and in the Face of their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly I proposed this Question, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends in the Ministry, where they are strangers, ought not to tell their Names, and Habitations upon their apparent sight of Informers coming into the Meeting, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Names of Friends in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:199413:146"/> the Meeting; that so they may stand in the same capacity, relating to sufferings with the Hearers; and not the Ministers in one capacity free from Sufferings, and the Hearers in another capacity <hi>i. e.</hi> always lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Sufferings, and not for themselves only, but also for the Meeting-houses, for the Poor and Indigent, for Strangers and Forreigners, and for the Preachers, unless they declare their Names and Places of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> This was such an unexpected and terrifying Question, that it set the Synod on Fire, and startled the most Eloquent Orator of them all; insomuch, that <hi>W. Penn</hi> steps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Form and adjourned the Meeting to <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly-down</hi> Meeting-house in <hi>Southwark,</hi> the next day at 7 in the Morning, where (after some private debate) it terminated thus; that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a Magistrate, or a Constable with his Staff came to a Meeting to demand the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Name and Habitation, he was at his liberty whether to declare it or no; upon which, finding which way the Hare run, I came home; and the Month of <hi>September</hi> following I gave <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> a personal Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to appear at our Monthly Meeting next following, at <hi>Chattirise</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> where I demanded Justice against <hi>Sam. Cater;</hi> but the Meeting refused and rejected my Reasons; and then I appealed from thence to the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting as Superior; but that Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also, thro the influence of <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> refused to do me right: Then I appealed from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:199413:147"/> thence to the Yearly Meeting <hi>Anno</hi> 1677. as Superior to them all; and as a preparatory for my matter, I wrot seven sheets of Paper to <hi>W. Penn,</hi> called <hi>Speeches and Passages</hi> grounded upon an Edict made at the Yearly Meeting <hi>Anno</hi> 1675. Whereby the Hearers were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged neither to <hi>forsake, decline,</hi> nor <hi>remove</hi> their Meetings, like <hi>worldly, fearful</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> Professors; and on that bottom, and for divers reasons grounded thereupon, I set forth the reasonableness that the Preachers [who thus advise and enjoyn the Hearers, and exhort them to stand valiant and give up all] should likewise stand the brunt, and not shrink and turn back like Cowardly Officers, and become the same worldly and politick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors they advise us not to be like. I also wrot a Letter to <hi>W. Penn, J. Crook,</hi> and <hi>R. Barkley,</hi> referring the matter in controversy to them. Thus being prepar'd, I went to the Yearly Meeting <hi>Anno</hi> 1677. and after some discourse with <hi>W. Penn,</hi> to give him his due, he used great diligence to get me a Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which was at <hi>Ed.

                  <p>But when the Quarterly Meeting came, which was the 5th. of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1677. I call'd for the written agreement; but <hi>Sam. Fulbig</hi> with whom it was entrusted, being <hi>Sam. Cater</hi>'s Creature would not produce it, neither would <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> allow, that the Meeting should chuse any but themselves. Moreover, the Meeting resolved against any other Election but themselves, by which I perceived their design; but, being tired with an endless pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, I at last, tho very unwillingly, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Meeting, who chose 12 out of themselves to examine the matter, and to put an end to the controversy, contrary to the condition of the recited agreement, which only impower'd the said Quarterly Meeting to chuse and elect, and not to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: However, they pretending they would do us equally Justice; I gave them my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which I had drawn from the Records of Conviction, and Warrant, and other things to set forth my right to the restitution of the said 15 <hi>l.</hi> being Fined for my self, for being at the said Meeting 10 <hi>s.</hi> besides this 15 <hi>l.</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:199413:148"/> for <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> as by the Books above quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I have largely set forth. Well, the 12 Persons took my Writings, and going up <hi>Rob. Letchworth</hi>'s Chamber, thorow the Kitchen, one of the 12 threw all my Writings into the Fire, and burnt them unexamined, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, or so much as look'd on any one passage to demonstrate my right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And about a quarter of an hour after, they sent for us; and we being come up the Chamber to them, one of the self-chosen Arbitrators directed his speech to us, that they had determined the matter, and found <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> clear, and my demand unreasonable; and that they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> and hoped that I would be quiet for the time to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom I replyed, that they had given away my right; and that I was able to demonstrate the same if they would hear me; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd it was ended, and that they hoped I would now sit down quiet, and rest satisfied, but they would not give me the Award, and so we parted; but going home, one— <hi>Dan.</hi> a Quaker call'd me to him, and said, <hi>Francis</hi> I am grieved to behold what foul play thou hast had to day; wherein said I? What dost thou mean? Why reply'd— <hi>Dan.</hi> I sat in the Kitchen as thy 12 Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors came thro' the House to go up the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and I saw one of them throw all the Papers thou gav'st them in the Meeting to peruse, and did burn them all without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on any one of them.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:199413:148"/>
                  <p>Whereupon I sent the said Arbitrators a large Paper call'd a Prescript, and Postscripts with Summons to appear at the next Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting, concluding them accountable for their actions upon their own Principles, in <hi>Ed. Burrow</hi>'s <hi>Works p.</hi> 442. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>And we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all Governors and Rulers <hi>ought</hi> to be accountable to the People, and to the next succeeding Rulers for <hi>all</hi> their Actions, which may be enquired into upon occasion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> My charge to them was 1. In that they did not pursue the Terms of the recited A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. 2. That according to the said A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement they ought to have chosen Men, and not to Arbitrate the matter themselves, when by the condition thereof they were only to chuse and elect. 3. That contrary to all rules of Law in that case, they refused me a Copy of their Award, and thereupon I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my self at liberty from their Award. 4. In that they burned my Evidences which set forth my Title to the restitution of the said 15 <hi>l.</hi> without any examination, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon condemned me unheard; all which put me upon writing the said Prescript in Prose, and Postscript in Verse; the latter follows in these words.</p>

                  <p>Having proceeded thus far in this old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, it will not be amiss to let the World see how <hi>Sam. Cater</hi>'s case was manag'd. First by partial Judges, as abovetold; and next by lying Lawyers: For, <hi>Tho. Rudyard, S. Cater</hi>'s Lawyer, thus said in his defence, about the 15 <hi>l.</hi> I suffered for <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> as aforesaid, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>The Fine of 15 <hi>l.</hi> was paid in Money volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, <hi>before</hi> distress was made, which is a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that our Testimony was ever against; and has been oftentimes 3 or 4 times the value of the thing demanded, and charge;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:199413:152"/> because they could neither pay, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for such spoiling their Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this went a great way with many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, that I should pay the Money vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily before distress was made; and the further in that <hi>Geo. Whitehead,</hi> who says in his Preface to his Book stil'd <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> &amp;c. <q>If I did not feel the Lord my God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a real necessity upon me to be publickly concerned in this controversy, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to sit down mute: But the Lord has laid the necessity, and in discharging my Duty, I neither consult events, nor fear ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> Now Reader observe, and I will shew thee one instance of many that might be mentioned, by which thou may'st measure the reality of this necessity which <hi>G. W.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends God [that cannot lye, nor move any to lye] laid upon him in such a degree, that he in writing that Book, neither consulted events nor yet feared effects: For, this <hi>T. Rudyard</hi> the Lawyer had said in defence of his Client <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> that I <hi>Fra. Bugg</hi> paid my 15 <hi>l.</hi> Fine voluntarily, <hi>before</hi> distress was made. And Reader this was a lye, as I can prove by 20 Witnesses still alive; for my Goods were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, and carried to an Inn, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>White Hart</hi> in our Town; and there lay until I entered my Appeal, at which time I paid the Money, and took my Goods again; and to the truth of what I say, and to prove <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> s lying necessity, I may recite a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:199413:152"/> Certificate under the Man and Womans hand, who at that time kept the House, <hi>viz.</hi>

But if Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> would open his Books of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, we should see how many Thousand Pounds their Speakers have in a Year, besides their private Quarters, who comes like Flies and Mice uncall'd, or unsent for; and so live on the Provision of others: And this I may say, that their Ministry hath cost me as much
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:199413:157"/> in 4 Weeks, as the publick Ministry has cost me in 4 Years; and yet, these are the free Preachers, free Writers, and free People if you will believe them.

                  <p>READER, by the First Part of this Book I have set forth the Quakers claim to their Tytle, to be the true Church of the First Born; and from their Books have proved the contrary; as also cleared the Magistracy from the <hi>Odium</hi> of Persecution: And by the second part I have Historically treated of the Rise, Growth, and Progress of Quakerism; shewing not so much the Names and Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft Professions of that People, the Places of their abode, with some other particulars thereabout; the same being excellently well done by the Author of the General History of the Quakers, but how and by what means Quakerisme hath advanced; and therein have modestly corrected the said Historian, and shewed him his mistakes in many things; as also corroborated and strengthened him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is right; and now I am come, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version's sake by way of Dialogue, to handle some points relating to both Parts, in which I shall suggest nothing, but what I stand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make appear: And this familiar Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course between <hi>Thomas</hi> a Preacher, and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamen</hi> their Clark, I shall endeavour further to illustrate the matter in hand, <hi>viz.</hi>

And that we deny Christ's coming out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in his glorify'd Body, to Judge both the quick and the dead; and the general day of Judgment, as in his Narrative p. 14. And I perceive the Apostate Christians are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pleased with this his Work, both Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians, Presbyterians, Independants, and Baptists; for, they all acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to all these Points, tho' in some things they differ each from others; and to be plain with you, I fear there is too much truth in what <hi>G. Keith</hi> says; pray how is it in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Merryland, East</hi> and <hi>West Jersy, Pensil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, Burmodoes, Antego, Mevis, Holland,</hi> and other parts where you Travel, holding forth Truth.</p>

                     <p>I do acknowledge that our Friend <hi>Barkly</hi> in his Anarchy p. 16. saith, <q>I find Professors make but small boasting of any Proselites they get from us; I hear little of their proving Champions for the Principles of others against us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> But to be plain, they so far prevail, that I find <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> the cunningest Writer we have [except Friend <hi>Penn,</hi> and <hi>Ellwood</hi>] is hardly able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; and to be free with you, <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath proved such a Champion for them, and against us, as that the City and Country, as well as parts beyond the Sea, ring of his fame, for he has lighted such a candle as we cannot blow cut, nor extinguish the light thereof,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:199413:161"/> for both he and others produce matter of Fact from our Books, which none of us, if we would speak truth, can deny; so that, to deal freely, I am of your mind; I fear there is too much truth in their Allegations against us on those four Heads, which are such four Fundamentals held by the Apostate Christians, and so proved by the Letter, which they call the word of God, that I know not what to think of these things.</p>

                     <p>Pray what think you of <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Miracles, mentioned in his Journal; some talk strangely of them, especially <hi>Fra. Bugg;</hi> and this I observe, that whereas the Miracle wrought by the Apostles in the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was a means to convert the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Christian Faith, and to confirm the believing <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But, these of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s, in regard he wrought them in his own Name only, they seem to be a means to shake the Faith and Confidence that some well wishers to us had of our Religion; nay, and to be plain, many amongst us begin to doubt of them, and to think them too like the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Legend, and the counterfeit Miracles of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that Sorcerer; and I my self am almost at a stand about them, and divers others of his assertions touching himself, which before our adversaries quoted them, I did not take so much notice of.</p>

                     <p>Friend <hi>Benjamen</hi> you are in the right of it; for, betwixt You and I, Christ never wrought Miracles in a corner, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:199413:161"/> them 20 or 30 years after they are said to be done, but in the face of the World, before multitudes of mixt People, Friends and Enemies; witness that of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> where he turned Water into Wine; likewise his feeding many Thousands with a few barly Loves, and a few small Fishes. He healed all manner of Diseases, whether the Disease were present or absent; and some of his Miracles he wrought on the Sabbath day, which the Pharasees, his great Enemies, found fault with him for, though they could not deny matter of Fact. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his Followers, who preached in his Name the Resurrection of the dead; they likewise wrought Miracles, saying, in the Name of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> rise up and walk; and he (the Cripple) walked, and leaped, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God.</p>

                     <p>Ah, these were Miracles indeed: But this <hi>Fra. Bugg</hi> makes the World believe that <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Miracles are meer shams, lying wonders, and delusions: and I must tell thee, I fear so too; and to be free, some Friends (tho' they dare not say it openly) think so as well as I; and for my part I do not like them at all.</p>

                     <p>Like them, who can? I was at a Friend's House not long since, where I heard an eminent Friend say, that since some had wrot so much against the Journal and Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> she had a mind to see it; and I asked her how she liked it; she said, she
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:199413:162"/> did not like it at all; and indeed, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider a few things, who can like it? For, 1. His Miracles were done in a corner no body knows where n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> when, otherwise than by his own relation. 2. Never published till many years after they are said to be done. 3. They were wrought in his own Name only, and not in the Name of Jesus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> 4. Here is not one Cripple that ever he cured, nor one dead Person that ever he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; nor one blind that ever he gave sight too, to come forth and avouch that he was cured, was raised, was blind and now he sees: and to be very plain, I do believe there never was any thing of a Miracle at all, but only an Artifice to hold the people in admiration of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and to confirm them in the belief that we are the only true Catholick Church of the First-born; and that the Apostolick order thereof, as well as Miracles, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored and re-established amongst us. But, let us have a care that no body hear us; for if this discourse were known to <hi>G. W.</hi> I should loose my place, and you might be in danger to loose yours.</p>

                     <p>Oh Friend, I have been a Quaker more than 20 years, and am ashamed to hear of such vain boasting: For indeed, if we were always thus furnished with discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and judgment on all occasions, so that we knew who were Saints, Devils, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states without speaking ever a word, how came it to pass that <hi>Sam.

Why is it sent to the University to be reserved to posterity in their Library? and to be free, I think our Friends run a whoring after it, as much as the revolting <hi>Israelites</hi> did after the golden Calf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>First.</hi> Why did our Brother, <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> send a Paper to <hi>Turners-hall,</hi> April 29. 1697. called a Protestation against <hi>George Keith</hi>'s Advertisement; and not come and defend our Books.</p>

                     <p>Why? You need not ask the Reason why? For <hi>George Keith</hi> call'd us forth to clear our selves from those four Fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; which both he, you, and I know, we can no way clear our selves; but by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation: And you know, we no sooner Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, then let fall our Infallibility; And this thee may'st assure thy self, <hi>G.

Moreover, we have Diologu'd the Prelates, and Church, and Common Prayer; and told them we have discovered their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Practices, and rip'd up her Bowels, and Discovered her (the Churches) Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Womb, and all her false Conceptions. <hi>p.</hi> 39.

If so, then we are in a better Station then the Church Established; for thee knowest how we Write against both Priests and People; we Summon, Arraign, Try, and Condemn them, as I said before; pray An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer me Cordially; do you think this is good Arguing? that because the Government have tolerated us, that therefore none may Write against us, that none may Challenge us.

                        <hi>Hubberthorn</hi>'s Works; there you shall find in Answer to the Baptists, who professed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, that if they were in their Hands, they would give the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Liberty of Conscience. In Answer to whom here our Brother <hi>Hubborthorn,</hi> an Eminent, and early Writer and Preacher, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>It seems then, there is not so much difference betwixt them, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi>) and you, (the Baptists] who will make them Antichristian, and you Christian. What Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is here? You will not tolerate Popery, nor such as Worship a false God, nor any that speak Contemptuously of the Lord Jesus Christ, nor any that deny the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word of God; and yet you are not against the tolerating Episcopacy Presbytetry, or any stinted form: Why will you not tolerate Popery, as well as Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy? Have not the Professors of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Murdered and Slain, and do Labour to Murder and Slay the People of God, as well as the Papists; and will you tolerate the Common Prayer among the Episcopacy, and not the Mass-book among the Papists; seeing that the Mass was the Substance, out of which the Common Prayer was Extracted. Here is nothing but Partiality to tolerate one Thing, and not another of the same kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Now Brother, you see how we are against Episcopacy, even as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popery, and should tolerate the one, as soon as the other. And to be plain, I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:199413:165"/> think the Episcopal are kinder to us than we deserve.</p>

Whitehead</hi> to be thus Unbelieving, and Presumptuous; for I am told the Lord Mayor, (with the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>) gave <hi>G. Keith</hi> leave, and sent his Marshal to keep the Peace; and that one of the Sheriffs was their also; and that the World's People (for so we call all but our selves) were well satisfied, and glad of the Opportunity, to hear the gross Errors, and vile Heresies of our Brethren laid open, and exposed to publick Notice.</p>

                     <p>I must again answer on the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, that our Brother <hi>Whitehead</hi> was first Unbelieving, and secondly, very Presumptive, and thereby Reflected on the Wisdom and Conduct of the Civil Magistrate, Arroganely signifying and suggesting, that the Magistrates are more ready to Recognize, Help, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist us; who have Arraigned, Tryed, and Condemn'd them all, who have Impeached their Proceedings, in their Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; who have Dialogu'd the Bishops, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and Teachers, who say, the Common Prayer is a Branch, Sprung from the Pope,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:199413:166"/> that the Pope gives Life and Breath to it; and that from the Popes Loins it draws its Strength; that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the Whore, and the Parliament the Beast that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her. That the Bishops and Ministers are Monsters, which from the Adulterous Womb of the Church are brought forth, that we have rip'd up the Bowels (of the Church) and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her Adulterous Womb. Saying, <hi>p.</hi> 39. And now behold ye Arch-bishops, Lord-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Deans, Prebends, Doctors, Vicars, and Curates, and all Prelaticals. Here is the Womb of your Conception opened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Brother <hi>Ben.</hi> all these things considered, what reason had our dear Brother in Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> to presume, (had not he been Impudent, as well as Presumptuous) That the Government should so far tolerate us, and not Assist <hi>G. Keith,</hi> who hold all the Essential Points of the Christian Faith, that the Men of the World hold, <hi>viz.</hi> First, That Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, as he Suffered, and rose again from the Dead, is necessary to our Salvation. Secondly, That Justification, and Sanctification; is by Faith in the Blood of Christ outwardly shed, being applyed by Faith and the Operation of his Holy Spirit in us. Thirdly, That after Death, there will be a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body that dyeth. Fourthly, And that Christ will come without us in his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Body, at the Day of Judgment, to Judge both the Quick and the Dead, and whose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples lead him to submit to Authority; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:199413:166"/> his keeping the Fast, appointed by King <hi>William,</hi> April 28. 1697. When our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Shops were open in Submission to the Commandment of our great Apostle <hi>G. Fox.</hi> I say all these things considered, I cannot but marvel at our Brother <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, not to say Impudence, really Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ben.</hi> I am perswaded we loose Ground, and I fear we are going downwards, and that our fall will be speedy, unless we sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Retract our Scandalous Books, and Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Writings; and though our Brother <hi>Whitehead,</hi> neither consult Events, nor fear Effects, I think it will stand us in hand to look about us.</p>
                     <p>So that we have little reason to boast of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Recognized Protestants, by such as we account Christians, and whom we would not tolerate no more then we would Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Papists, or such as Worship false Gods, as this Book of ours Teach.</p>

                     <p>Fifthly, Well, come, 'tis not very late, and since we are entred into Discourse, let us talk freely, I will warrant thee, that <hi>John Pennyman, George Keith, Francis Bugg,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Crisp,</hi> before they left us, have had many an Hours Discourse of this Kind, pray then what think you of <hi>G. Whitehead;</hi> is he not very bold to send out the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Protestation against the meeting ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>G. Keith.</hi> And therein to be so Presumptuous, as to suggest, that <hi>G. Keith</hi> had not License of the Civil Authority, as if
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:199413:167"/> he knew the Lord Mayors Place, and Power better than himself.</p>

                     <p>I Answer, <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bold but Impudent. But what shall I say, I have of late seen his Books, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and 'tis like him every way; I remember I saw a Friend that was lately in the <hi>North,</hi> and saw his House where he was born, not worth Fifty Shillings: I Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed another, that said he came among us a poor Boy on foot, and lived upon Alms; yet lately Riding out of Town, he had <hi>Ben. Antrobus</hi> to ride before him, and <hi>Tho. Kent,</hi> one of our Ministers, worth many Hundreds of Pounds, rod behind him, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his Portmantel, and he in State in the mdidle, like some Peer; which answers the Old Proverb; set a Beggar on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and he knows not how to Ride. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for us that account the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christians, Summon the Bishops, Dialogue the Clergy, Arraign, Try, and Condemn the Protestants; and declare in our Books, that tis as Laudable to tolerate Popery, as Episcopacy: And after all this, to presume that the Government thus Condemned, will so stand by us, Assist us, and Defend us, as not to have our Errors exposed, this is such Presumption, and manifest Impudence, that I presume hath not a Parallel.</p>

                     <speaker>Clark.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, but I have heard, that in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as in <hi>France;</hi> that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:199413:167"/> do not permit the Presbyterians to hold a Synod, unless they have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner Recide therein; but I confess, we are above that. First, we scorn to ask the World's People leave; for we once a Year, in Whitson-Week hold a Synod, keep our Doors Lock'd, or else a good Guard to keep out the World's People, and when we are met, we consider what Laws the Worldly Magistrates have made, which sute not with our Light within. And if we find any for paying Tythes, or Repairing Churches, or the like; them we give warning to all our Associates, through the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed;</hi> not to pay to them, but Testifie against them, as a Grand, <hi>viz.</hi> a great Oppression; and not only so, but which is ten times worse, an Antichristian Yoke; and thereby Absolve our Disciples from their Obedience to the Laws of the Land. And if the King himself give forth a Proclamation to keep a Fast, we matter it no more than we do their Law for Tyth's; they being both against the Commandment of <hi>George Fox,</hi> our great Apostle, see part the first, <hi>p.</hi> 12. Now the Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not great Impudence.</p>

                     <p>Answer, yea; and if I do answer, I must say yea, but 'tis like all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. For First, our Books teach, that <hi>George Fox</hi> was Glorified at <hi>Lancaster</hi> Assize, 1664. That none knew him, nor his Name,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:199413:168"/> that he was before Languages were, part the fiirst, <hi>p.</hi> 38. That he see the Heavens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; that he was in the Paradise of God, so fill'd with Power, having on his Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bretches, that the Worlds People did fly before him; that in <hi>Beverly</hi> Church, he was like an Angel, and spoke the Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things of God: The Voice of God came to a Trooper, and bid him go to <hi>G. Fox</hi> for Direction; <hi>F. Howgill</hi> said of him, that he spake with Authority, and not like the Scribes; <hi>Jos. Cole,</hi> said his Kingdom was Established in Righteousness, and of the Increase thereof, there shall be no end. <hi>Sol. Eccles,</hi> said of him, the World was made by him, <hi>John Audland,</hi> said, Dear and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious one, in whom my Life is bound up, and my Strength in thee stands. Then he went through the City of <hi>Litchfield</hi> barefoot, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wo! wo! to the Bloody City of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiield;</hi> I saw in the Street a Pole of Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a hundred Lves, Stories, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and pretended Miracles in his Journal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for us to think that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be against the Discovery of these, and the like Errors; no, let us not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, I am truly Brother <hi>Ben.</hi> afraid that <hi>G. Keith, Francis Bugg, Thomas Crisp,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers follow us up so to the Heels, as at last we shall be forced either to Retract our Errors, or do worse, and then we shall go down faster then we got up: And so fare thee well, till I see the next Volume of <hi>G. Fox.</hi> I must go hence, 'tis late.</p>

                  <head>The Conclusion.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>

                  <p>I think the Friends have spoke more truth in a corner in two or three hours time, than all their Leaders have Preached this 20 years. But say some, if these things be so in very deed, how came they to obtain so many and frequent Favours of the Government? I Answer, because the Parliament do not know them, no more than <hi>Constantius</hi> knew the Hypocrisy of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who at length, thro' their subtle delusions, and fair pretences, prevail'd and got the Pulpit and the Orthodox banished; and I have heard some fear the like consequence respecting the Quakers: But, let such be satisfied that Quakerism is at the heighth and begins to tumble; and our Governours, both of Church and State, begin to see them. I remember that in 1693. They were very fair to obtain a Bill for their solemn Affirmation to go for an Oath; but when I deliver'd in my sheet, shewing their Principles, in two hours time it was thrown out, and, as <hi>Col. Goldwell</hi> told me, there was not a Man appeared for them; and when I came to <hi>London, March</hi> 1696. some worthy Members of the Commons House chid me for not coming sooner, saying they wanted matter of Fact; adding that the Quakers frequent and unwearied Sollicitation prevail'd with too many worthy Gentlemen, who understand not their undermining Principles. However much good may their obtained Bill do 'em, since the 10 <hi>l.</hi> clause is in, and they barr'd from any place of Trust, so much as of being Constable: And whereas their judgment is, <hi>whatever is more than yea, yea, and nay, nay, cometh of evil,</hi> and is Swearing, yet now they must call God to witness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is indeed not less nor more than an Oath; and this pleases some of them that could Swear before, but some it displeases who say, the Act do them no good; for whatever is more than yea, yea, nay, nay, is Swearing. Well, but may some say, have not the Quakers Merrited the favour bestowed on them, yea by the rule of contraries, for the Quakers have Recogniz'd the Parliament Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:199413:169"/> the Beast that carry the Whore; and that it's as commendable to give Liberty of Conscience to the Papists, nay to a People that worship false Gods, graven Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to tollerate Episcopacy, the false Church, whose Bowels they have ripped up; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the Common Prayer Book is Popery, and from the Loyns of the Pope receiv'd its Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Parliament have, as they pretend and often boast, Recogniz'd them Protestant Dissenters, give them their Liberty without any restraint; but how? not knowing them nor their Principles, but, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> was; are mistaken in them, whose Books and Carriages are of two sorts. I remember the last Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suntide in <hi>Northcoat</hi>'s Shop in <hi>George-yard Lombard-street, W. Mead</hi> the great Quaker, asked me, if I broke Bread with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I said yea; what, said he, dost thou lick up thy old Vomit? I'll warrant you he said no such word to the Worthy Members of the House of Commons, nor to the Bishops of the Church; no, no, as their Books carry two different Faces, so do their Carrage; and if it be Criminal to conceal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against my natural Prince, what is it to conceal these Impostors? who undervalue the Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ; condemn his Laws, despise his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, revile his Magistrates, and reproach his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, which I hope this Book fully sets forth; and which I stand ready to prove out of their Books upon <hi>G. W.</hi>'s Proposition to the Parliament, as cited by me, in the First Part p. 123. And until they do so meet, and if proved upon them, then Retract them, they are not to be believed, tho' in their Meetings they like the Magitians in <hi>Moses</hi>'s time may make the likeness of the same Confession and Profession that <hi>G, Keith</hi> and others do, as well as in their late Books; yet while their other Books, which teach the contrary, stand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned, the Quakers are Quakers still, and their Principles diametrically opposite to all Christians, Saints and Martyrs in all Ages; and they ought to be guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against, as Enemies to Church and State.</p>

                  <p>HAving since the foregoing was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted off, seen a Book, Entituled, <hi>Some Seasonable Reflections upon the Quakers Protestation against the Proceedings at</hi> Turners-hall, <hi>April</hi> 29. 1697. &amp;c. Wrote by an Ingenious Hand. Wherein the said Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor marvels, (as well he may) that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers should Accuse <hi>G. Keith</hi> for Invading of Property; who themselves hold it no Sin to Invade the Properties of others; as in the Case of Tyth's; which are as much the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty's of the Clergy (Confirmed by Act of Parliament) as any Man's Estate in <hi>England;</hi> nay, not only so, but (as the Author well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves) in other things, from several Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which <hi>G. Fox,</hi> &amp;c. sent to the Parliament of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> Printed, 1659. p. 8. 32. Particular, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>Let all those Fines that belong to Lords of Mannors be given to the Poor, for Lords have enough. Particular 29. Let all those Abby-lands, Gleab-lands that is given to the Priests, be given to the Poor of the Nation; let all the Abby's, Steeple-houses, and <hi>Whitehall,</hi> be for Alms-houses, for the Blind and the Lame to be there. And in the fore-mentioned Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:199413:170"/> to the Parliament, 1659. Subscribed by above 7000 Quakers, p. 59. 63, and 65. They require that the Late King, (as these Rebels Stil'd him) his Rents, Parks, and Houses should be Sold, and all the Colledges and Lands, and the very Bells out of the Churches, except one in a Town, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> This was no Invading of Property in them; but for <hi>G. Keith,</hi> or any others, to Detect their Errors; this is Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Properties, as <hi>English-men,</hi> yea forsooth Persecution: But say's <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> in his Word of Advice to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, p. 2. <q>Give the Priests Blood to drink; for they are worthy, Slay <hi>Baal,</hi> turn the Hirelings out of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> Here was no design of Persecution, or hurting any Man's Property, or of Reviling, and Blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the Reputation of Free-born <hi>English-men,</hi> and exposing them to the Fury of the Mob, to the Scorn, Contempt, and Rage of the mixt Multitude, who are Unmeet to Judge of Religious Controversies, as these Meek Lambs, the Quakers urge against <hi>G. Keith</hi> in their Protestation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that they are not chang'd, see their last Yearly Epistle, 1696. Wherein they Exhort their Disciples, not to be mov'd at the Objections against their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; <q>
                        <hi>But to hold up the</hi> Holy <hi>Testimony</hi> of Truth, which hath made us, say they, a People to God, and Preserved us unto this Day: And that in all the parts of it; for Truth is one, and changes not; and what it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:199413:170"/> convinc'd us of to be Evil in the beginning, it Reproves still, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> i. e. The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and all the Magistrates, Kings, Lords, and Commons, to be Serpents, Devils, and Scarlet-coloured Beasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Truth is one (say they) and changes not, <hi>i. e.</hi> Quak. who are, and always have been in the Truth, have not chang'd at all since the beginning. So that 'tis plain, that as they are the same still, so have they made themselves answerable; for all that have been said by them since their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And therefore in order to draw a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Map of Quakerism, I shall consider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who the Quakers Account False Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How they pass Sentence on them as such.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And particularly, what bitter Enemies they are against Episcopacy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Who the Quakers account true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the true Church, the Bride, the Lamb's Wife.</p>
                  <p>And first, who they account False Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as Sprinkle Infants, and tell People it is an Ordinance of <hi>Christ. George Fox</hi>'s <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> p. 84.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as Preach Christ without, and bid People believe in him, as he is in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s <hi>Primmer,</hi> p. 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All that do study the Scriptures, and Preach out of them, <hi>&amp;c. Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand to</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:199413:171"/>4. All that either Receive, or Pay Tyth's, <hi>&amp;c. Thomas Ellwood</hi>'s <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 78.</p>
                  <p>I could give a hundred Instances of the like Nature, by these Primmers and Books they Teach their Children, and Inculcate these hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Principles into their Disciples, <hi>viz.</hi> That all that Baptize with Water, all that Preach out of the Scriptures, all that Preach Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as he is in Heaven above at God's right Hand, making Intercession for us: As our for ever Blessed and Adored Advocate. In short, all that Pay, or Receive Tyth's: And thus have they Sentenced, not only the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Independents, and Baptists, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Martyr's, and Christians in all Ages, and they are the same still, they are not chang'd; and by this they shall be proved to be the same, in that, 1st. They so Profess to be, in all the Parts of Quakerism, and 2ly. In that they refuse to Retract and Condemn these their Antichristian Principles. Again, Thirdly, How they, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Quakers pass Sentence on them as such, see their Book. <hi>A Brief Discovery of a Three-Fold Estate of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> &amp;c. p. 7. 8, 9, 10.

                     <p>Reader, I have in this little Map, given thee a hint of the Doctrines of the Quaker Church: I think they are so abominable Erronious, Blasphemous, and Uncharitable, that they need no Comment; and as to the Quaker Church, their Bride, and their Lambs Wife; if you still ask me for a Discription of her; I tell you they are a broken divided Sect; who
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:199413:176"/> adhear to the Teachers of this Doctrine; tho' in their Meetings before the World's People; they sometimes talk a little otherwise, but search their Books, especially their old ones (and they are not changed) and this is the perfect Figure, nay, plain Words of their Doctrine. But if any one, or more will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their Recited Errors publickly under their Hands; they thenceforth are not of their Church, but ought to be taken in as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, even as <hi>G. Keith</hi> and his Friends have done, whom I neither Interrogate nor Accuse. And now if after all, their deluded Disciples, will not be so noble, as to search, and after searching to to Renounce them, and their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but will still remain willingly Ignorant; it is a great sign that God has given them up to strong Delusion.</p>
                     <p>Reader, the design of the Recited Book, Intituled, <hi>Some Reflections upon the Quakers Protestation,</hi> &amp;c. And all that's Wrote against them, is only to bring them to a thorow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their Errors; and to such an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and Confession of them, as is Indispensible to a true Conviction; there is nothing more desired of them than to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and disown what is proved to be Faulty in their Writings, and such Faults too, as are either Destructive to the Faith, or Scandalous (and so Sinful) to the Reputation of their Neighbours, in giving False and Uncharitable Representations of them: And this they are obliged to do by all the Rulers of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:199413:177"/> it being the smallest Satisfaction they can make, to repair (so far at least) the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that are thereby done to the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the Good Name of those they have Wrongfully Traduced; they are the Aggres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, they have Attack'd our Religion in all the Parts of it, our Bishops, and Clergy, and our whole Constitution; and we require no greater Amends for all that they have done against us, then to say that they are sorry for it, and though they should refuse us, even this Justice, and reasonable Security for the future; yet we press for no Persecution against them, for no Fines, or Imprisonment; but only that we should not be obliged to acknowledge them as true Protestants; and that we may have Liberty to Justifie our Selves and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, against the Calumnies with which they have loaded both: And if this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused us, the Cry of Persecution will run on our side: Is it no Persecution of the Tongue for the Quakers to Represent our Bishops and Clergy, as the most odious of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>We grant their is a Toleration, but 'tis only for Religious Worship, but with all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Doors be open; so as any may go in and see what they do; but not to hold General Councels, with their Doors Lock'd up, or a Guard of three or four Stout Men to keep all out, but whom they'll admit; and their Business is Government, that's plain, which is no way within the Act of Parliament; for there is a Clause in the Act, p. 307. <hi>Be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:199413:177"/> it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Assembly of Persons, Dissenting from the Church of England, shall be had in any Place for Religious Worship</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mark, tho' they do not always Bolt and Barr, yet have they 3 or 4 lusty Fellows to keep Guard during their Convocation.</note>
                        <hi>with the Doors lockt, bar'd or bolted, during any time of such Méeting together, they shall not receive any benefit from this Law; but be lyable to all the Pains and Penalties of all the aforesaid Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Now if the Bishops and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> tho' Recogniz'd and Establish'd by Law, wou'd incur a Premunire; so much as to meet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, and debate, tho' concerning only their own Order and Spiritual Jurisdiction, without the King's Licence. How then have the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers this Authority to hold their yearly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation without controle; and with their Doors either lock'd and bar'd, or a Guard at them; and when there, not only to make Laws for their People to observe, but to Repeal, if not Verbally, yet Vertually the Laws of the Land.</p>
                     <p>And further, If when the Clergy do meet in Council, Convocation, or Synod; the King may have his Commissioners present to Inspect and even to Regulate their Proceedings, That nothing may be their Transacted prejudicial to the Government: How much more reasonable is it to have the Quakers Synods Inspected,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:199413:178"/> who have given such demonstration of their Antimagistratical Principles. If Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and Princes have had their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and Ministers present in general Councils; If the Hugonots in <hi>France</hi> have submitted, nay desired and requested to have the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners present in their Synods, which by His Majesties Grace and Favour they have been suffered to hold: If the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' now Establish'd as the National Religion, have a Commissioner present in their general Assemblies, why should the Quakers not be oblig'd to receive a Commissioner from the Government to recide in their Anniversary Synods. If at their beginning they were too Inconsiderable for the notice of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they are now become a numerous and wealthy People; and in all respects worthy not to be neglected; especially if their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be as their Writings set forth: And their not meeting <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and others who have in like manner challeng'd them, is not the least demonstration of their Guilt.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>G. W</hi>'s. <hi>Antidote,</hi> 252. Answer, as his Character of <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> is in the Superlative Degree, appears Flattery, and his Scandalous Story's on his behalf; and reason of leaving us, appears neither True, nor Impartial: I never had any undeniable Proof of the Matter of Fact heard from <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> Well done <hi>George,</hi> thou art in the right on't; for I never knew any Matter of Evil Fact Charged on the Quakers, and their Errors; but thou hast had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to deny it, at least as Stated, or in some other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical manner: So that 'tis Morally Impossible to prove Matter of Fact against the Quakers undenyably True. Why? because they have a Face of Brass, to deny any Matter of Fact against them; how true soever it be, of which this Antidote is not the least Instance; and for which Reason, I could wish the Author of the <hi>Snake</hi> may not trouble himself to Reply:</p>
                     <p>Again, 2dly. p. 254. <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> has Cited a Passage in the <hi>Snake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz. Quakers Registring their Sufferings for the Truth</hi> (as they call it) would make them exceed all the Ten Persecutions, and to be more Undescerving than the Sufferings of Christ himself, or the Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> Answers. <q>These are False Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, we have no such hopes he (<hi>i. e.</hi> Snake) Cites <hi>Edward Burrough</hi>'s Unfairly, and Partially in this Point: And yet the Comparison of the Quakers Sufferings, as Greater, and more Unjust than in the Days of Christ,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:199413:179"/> and his Apostles, or any time since, is a mistake. And whether it was to first Verbally Stated by <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s, or some time since; I shall not Determin, unless I see the Original Copy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> I do positively Affirm, and before any Ten Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Protestant Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> Episcopal, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Independent, or Baptists, will prove that the from Recited Authors Charge is undeniably true Matter of Fact. But what then, <hi>G. W.</hi> still complains of Evil Suggestions, of Unfair, and Partial Citations; tho' poor Heart he is so Stung with this Snake, that he is forced to acknowledge a Mistake, some where, but dust not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min where; oh horrible! what, a Book Wrote in 1657. by one of their Inspired Prophets, as the Word of the Lord, and dispersed 15 Years up and down the Nations; and then Reprinted, by thy own Approbation, dear <hi>George,</hi> with thine, and <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Epistles of Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. And now to tell us of a Mistake, but know not where, and to call for Original Manuscripts, Wrote 40 Years since; is such a piece of Fallible Infallibility; that had I room, I should farther enlarge upon it.</p>
